**Figure 1.** Line chart displaying the frequency of keywords "recall," "cognition," and "cognitive psychology" in Robert Bjork's publications from 1970 to 2025. Data is sourced from `WordFreqOverTime.csv` and illustrates the thematic evolution of his research focus over time.

### Analysis of Thematic Evolution

The visualization compellingly illustrates the cognitive turn within memory research through the evolving frequency of key terms in Robert Bjork's publications. In the early phase of his career, "recall" is a prominent keyword, signifying a focus on the behavioral aspects of memory. However, as the years progress, there is a clear and steady rise in the frequency of "cognition" and "cognitive psychology," which eventually surpass "recall." This trend strongly suggests a paradigm shift in Bjork's research, moving from a purely behavioral perspective to a more comprehensive cognitive framework. The increasing prominence of "cognitive psychology" not only reflects a change in terminology but also a deeper theoretical reorientation, aligning with the broader cognitive revolution in psychology. This chart serves as a powerful visual anchor for the argument that Bjork's work is a prime example of this intellectual transition, providing a data-driven foundation for the subsequent analysis of his theoretical innovations.
