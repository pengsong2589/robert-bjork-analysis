This paper reports three paired- associate probe experiments designed to assess whether Ss could take advantage of a signal to forget some or all of the pairs presented prior to the signal. As it turns out, the effects of a forget signal are considerable: to- be- forgotten pairs do not interfere at all with the recall of to- be- remembered pairs. A theory of intentional forgetting is proposed that assumes Ss (a) organize the remember items into a grouping that functionally separates them from the forget items and (b) devote all rehearsal activities following the forget instruction to the remember items."

Any attempt to recall requires a judgment, on the basis of some criterion or another, of suitability or appropriateness.

Thus, the recall problem is analogous in the foregoing sense to detecting a signal against a noise background."

Also, the pairs in each color A sublist and in each color B sublist were rotated across Ss to insure that the same paired associates were tested at each serial position of a particular sublist.

In a very real sense, however, the problem may be at least partly a matter of insufficient or inefficient forgetting.

Computers handle the problem in a straightforward if somewhat drastic way. When new information is read into a location in memory, old information at that location is destroyed. Whatever the analogous human mechanism, it is certainly not so simple, nor so complete."

In the standard Brown- Peterson paradigm (Brown, 1954; Peterson & Peterson, 1959) there is an implicit instruction to forget at the end of each trial. The presence of preceding trials nonetheless produces considerable proactive interference. Since the cue to recall in the Brown- Peterson paradigm does not point to the to- be- remembered item in"
