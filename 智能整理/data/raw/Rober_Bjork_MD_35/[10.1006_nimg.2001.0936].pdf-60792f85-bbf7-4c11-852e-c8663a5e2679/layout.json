                                    "content": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a fundamental role in internally guided behavior. Although it is generally accepted that PFC subserves working memory and executive control operations, it remains unclear whether the subregions within lateral PFC support distinct executive control processes. An event- related fMRI study was implemented to test the hypothesis that ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC are functionally distinct, as well as to assess whether functional specialization exists within ventrolateral PFC. Participants performed two executive control tasks that differed in the types of control processes required. During rote rehearsal, participants covertly rehearsed three words in the order presented, thus requiring phonological access and maintenance. During elaborative rehearsal, participants made semantic comparisons between three words held in working memory, reordering them from least to most desirable. Thus, in addition to maintenance, elaborative rehearsal required goal- relevant coding of items in working memory (\"monitoring\") and selection from among the items to implement their reordering. Results revealed that left posterior ventrolateral PFC was active during performance of both tasks, whereas right dorsolateral PFC was differentially engaged during elaborative rehearsal. The temporal characteristics of the hemodynamic responses further suggested that dorsolateral activation lagged ventrolateral activation. Finally, differential activation patterns were observed within left ventrolateral PFC, distinguishing between posterior and anterior regions. These data suggest that anatomically separable subregions within lateral PFC may be functionally distinct and are consistent with models that posit a hierarchical relationship between dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions such that the former monitors and selects goal- relevant representations being maintained by the latter. © 2001 Academic Press"

In the human, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data have highlighted the relation between PFC and the controlled retrieval, selection, maintenance, and/or manipulation of goal- relevant representations (Christoff and Gabrieli, 2000; D'Esposito et al., 1998; Smith and Jonides, 1999; Stuss and Benson, 1984; Wagner, 1999). In nonhuman primates, electrophysiological and lesion studies have shown that PFC is necessary for the maintenance of item or goal representations (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Goldman- Rakic, 1987; Jacobsen, 1936; Miller et al., 1996), as well as for the monitoring, manipulation, or evaluation of such representations (Petrides, 1991, 2000). Such observations indicate that PFC is a fundamental component of the neural architecture supporting executive control (Miyake and Shah, 1999)."

One unresolved issue is whether the subregions within lateral PFC differentially mediate functionally distinct control processes or the same underlying process. Anatomically, lateral PFC consists of multiple subregions that differ in cytoarchitecture and connectivity (Petrides and Pandya, 1994), raising the possibility that these subregions may guide goal- directed behavior through different mechanisms."

Within this framework, ventrolateral PFC differentially subserves controlled retrieval of representations from posterior cortices, with some theorists also positing that ventrolateral PFC guides active online maintenance of the accessed representations (e.g., Christoff and Gab"

In this condition, subjects mentally reordered the triplet of nouns along the subjective dimension of \"desirability,\" ordering the words from least to most desirable. Thus, in addition to phonological maintenance of the nouns, this task required semantic comparisons between, and goal- directed relative coding of, the items in working memory (monitoring) and selection from among the items so as to mentally implement their reordering. That is, subjects had to monitor the contents of working memory by comparing the retrieved semantic knowledge associated with each item along the prespecified criterion of desirability and then, based on these comparisons, to select the items in accord with their relative rankings."

Comparison of Elab to Fix revealed activation in left VLPFC and bilateral DLPFC, whereas comparison of Rote to Fix revealed activation primarily in left posterior VLPFC (Fig. 2A). This pattern was consistently observed at the individual subject level (Figs. 2B and 2C). Specifically, almost all subjects revealed significant VLPFC and bilateral DLPFC activation during the Elab condition (Table 2). By contrast, during Rote rehearsal, while almost all subjects demonstrated left posterior VLPFC activation, only half of the subjects demonstrated significant left anterior VLPFC and left DLPFC activation and only one subject demonstrated right DLPFC activation. This pattern suggests that the pattern of task- related activation differed across VLPFC and DLPFC,"

Although the present design does not permit a direct refutation of this possibility, we believe a difficulty account is unlikely for three reasons. First, prior studies that have directly manipulated task difficulty (as indexed by reaction time) have failed to "

Second, as discussed above, a lag in the time to peak was observed between VLPFC and DLPFC regions within the Elab condition (by definition this difference could not arise from between- task differences in difficulty). Finally, given that the present findings converge with prior observations of putative process dissociations within lateral PFC (D'Esposito et al., 1998; Owen et al., 1996; Postle et al., 1999), we would suggest that the observed interactions are more likely to derive from process distinctions rather than differential cognitive effort."

Given the demands of the Elab and Rote tasks, posterior VLPFC activation was expected—and was observed—during both tasks, whereas anterior VLPFC activation was predicted to be particularly robust during the Elab trials."

Differential patterns of functional activation were observed between left posterior VLPFC, left anterior VLPFC, and right DLPFC regions of interest. (A) Displayed are the selectively averaged task-related hemodynamic responses from VLPFC and DLPFC regions of interest. The examined ROIs are displayed on corresponding axial slices. The hemodynamic responses reveal that the Elab task recruited both VLPFC and DLPFC processes, whereas the Rote task primarily engaged VLPFC processes. Consideration of the DLPFC responses to the Rote trials suggests that these regions were minimally engaged during Rote rehearsal, although a modest response peaked following trial termination. The black bar corresponds to the trial duration. (B) Displayed are the observed hemodynamic responses elicited by the Elab task in VLPFC and DLPFC regions.

The results revealed differential patterns of activation between ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC regions, as well as different patterns within ventrolateral PFC. Performance of a rote rehearsal task that relied primarily upon phonological access and maintenance mechanisms elicited activation in left posterior ventrolateral PFC and, to a lesser extent, in left anterior ventrolateral PFC and left dorsolateral PFC. Rote rehearsal, however, minimally engaged right dorsolateral PFC. By contrast, robust activation was observed in ventrolateral and bilateral dorsolateral PFC during performance of an elaborative rehearsal task that additionally required semantic comparisons across items in working memory (monitoring) and selection from among these items in a goal- directed manner. The effect of task interacted with PFC region, and the hemodynamic response elicited by performance of the elaborative task was lagged in dorsolateral relative to ventrolateral PFC."

Consideration of the selectively averaged hemodynamic response in right DLPFC during rote rehearsal (Fig. 3A) indicated that activation did not markedly differ from baseline (although there was a modest response that peaked following trial termination), and only one subject demonstrated significant rote- related activation in this region (Table 2). These data converge with a number of recent functional neuroimaging reports suggesting that the maintenance of item information minimally engages right DLPFC (D'Esposito et al., 1998; Owen, 1997; Smith and Jonides, 1999), as well as with recent lesion data in nonhuman primates (Petrides, 2000). For example, using fMRI, Rowe and colleagues (2000) observed that, whereas selection from among maintained spatial representations elicited dorsolateral activation, maintenance per se did not result in an appreciable dorsolateral response (see also Collette et al., 1999). Rypma and D'Esposito (2000) observed delay period activity in three right DLPFC voxels in one study, but failed to replicate this effect in a second study. Moreover, Petrides (2000) reported that excision of mid- DLPFC did not disrupt visual working memory performance even when a low load had to be maintained for up to 2 min. However, as the maintenance load increased, performance declined following mid- DLPFC lesion even with a short delay of 10 s. The present data build on this literature by providing evidence that right DLPFC and left VLPFC demonstrate"

Moreover, the present rote rehearsal task required maintenance of three words, whereas the item recognition studies revealing maintenance- related DLPFC activation required rehearsal of five letters (D'Esposito et al., 1999; Postle et al., 1999). This difference in the number of to- be- maintained items may account for the divergence of our results from these earlier findings. However, other fMRI data indicate that direct manipulations of working memory load do not consistently elicit increased DLPFC delay period activity with greater loads. Rather, load appears to affect DLPFC activity during the stimulus encoding period (Postle et al., 1999; Rypma and D'Esposito, 1999). These load effects have been interpreted as deriving from monitoring demands during stimulus encoding (Rypma and D'Esposito, 1999; Rypma et al., 1999). Although further investigation is required to clarify these between- study differences, the present findings, in conjunction with the recent lesion data (Petrides, 2000), suggest that right DLPFC may play only a modest role in item maintenance tasks (at least at lower loads)."

Nevertheless, the present temporal difference between VLPFC and DLPFC responses is provocative because the pattern is in accord with the \"two- stage\" hypothesis of cognitive control, in which DLPFC is thought to operate on the products of VLPFC (Owen et al., 1996; Petrides, 1994b; Petrides, 1996). At the cognitive level, access and maintenance of phonological and semantic codes—posited to be mediated by left posterior and anterior VLPFC, respectively—would appear to be required before participants can reorder the items because the monitoring and/or selection processes engaged during item reordering—posited to be mediated by DLPFC—likely operate or depend on such codes. Additional data from studies that integrate high temporal resolution imaging, such as magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography, with fMRI are required to resolve whether these temporal differences reflect a two- stage engagement of cognitive and neural processes or regional differences in the vascular response."

Based on the present design and the extant literature, we have interpreted the observed patterns of activation as reflecting a VLPFC/DLPFC distinction between maintenance and monitoring processes. However, because the present experiment manipulated executive control demands with two tasks, it is difficult to further specify the precise cognitive control operations subserved by these PFC subregions. Moreover, given the complexity of the elaborative rehearsal task it remains possible that the observed right DLPFC activation might have arisen from an increased working memory load in this condition (i.e., the increase in load that follows semantic retrieval and that might accompany the reordering of elements in working memory). Although, as discussed above, prior observations of increasing DLPFC activation with working memory load have been interpreted as deriving from increased demands on monitoring operations rather than on maintenance processes (Rypma and D'Esposito, 1999; Rypma et al., 1999), the present design does not permit definitive adjudication between these possibilities."

This distinction between ventrolateral and dorsolateral processes may reflect differences in their locus of operation (Petrides, 1996). PFC has been posited to represent goal states and to actively bias the processing of goal- relevant representations (Cohen and Servan- Schreiber, 1992; Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Miller and Cohen, 2001). Models of PFC functional organization raise the possibility that ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC bias mechanisms operate on different loci or types of representations (Miller and Cohen, 2001). Specifically, VLPFC may play a greater role in modulating processing or representations in posterior cortices, whereas DLPFC may differentially modulate processing or representations in VLPFC (Petrides, 1996). In this manner, ventrolateral bias or selection mechanisms may support access to and maintenance of item representations, whereas dorsolateral bias mechanisms may operate on the representations being maintained within working memory or on the maintenance processes themselves, thus supporting the selection of goal- relevant knowledge (Rowe et al., 2000)."
