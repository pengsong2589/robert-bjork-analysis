Other information associated with the same cue or configuration of cues, however, becomes less recallable. Such retrieval- induced forgetting (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994) appears to reflect the suppression of competing nontarget information, with this suppression facilitating the selection of target information. But is success at such selection a necessary condition for retrieval- induced forgetting? Using a procedure in which some cues posed an impossible retrieval task for participants, we report evidence that the attempt to retrieve, even if unsuccessful, can produce retrieval- induced forgetting. This finding, we believe, supports and refines a suppression/inhibitory account of retrieval- induced forgetting.",

Without some means to suppress or set aside information that has become outdated or irrelevant, humans would become vulnerable to a devastating accumulation of proactive interference, greatly impeding the ability to learn and access current information. Stated more broadly, a memory system, to be efficient and adaptive, must have mechanisms that render desired or target information more accessible and potentially interfering information less accessible.",

The spreading activation idea, for example, which is a prominent assumption in associative models of memory, seems to predict that strengthening some members of a given category should strengthen other members of that category as well. Covert rehearsal of other members of a given category, such as orange during the effort to retrieve lemon, might also be expected to increase the subsequent recall of  $\\mathbf{Rp}-$  items.

According to this view, the attempt to retrieve a target item also activates other items associated with the same retrieval cue(s), creating competition and requiring that the competing items be selected against. Intrinsic to such selection is the inhibition of competing items, which is then presumed to impair their subsequent recall. Thus, RIF can be thought of as an adaptive process that functions to resolve interference from competing information in order to facilitate the retrieval of target information and, in so doing, reduces access to the information that is selected against.",

According to most noninhibitory accounts, RIF should be cue dependent because it is the strengthening, during practice, of the association between  $\\mathbf{Rp}+$  items and a specific cue- namely, the cue presented at study- that then leads to interference with or blocking of  $\\mathbf{Rp}-$  items in response to that cue on the final recall test. If, instead, another cue is presented, there is no reason to assume that  $\\mathbf{Rp}+$  items will also be more strongly associated with that cue and, thus, able to interfere with or block retrieval of the  $\\mathbf{Rp}-$  items. In contrast, Anderson and Spellman (1995) demonstrated that  $\\mathbf{Rp}-$  items are recalled at a diminished rate not only when tested with the same category cue as that presented during study, but also when tested with a novel category cue. After participants learn cherry as an exemplar of the category fruit, for example, and then receive retrieval practice on fruitorange, subsequent recall of cherry is impaired, not only when tested via fruit- c- , but also when tested via red- c. RIF has now been shown, across a number of studies and laboratories, to be cue independent (see Anderson, 2003, for a summary), providing strong evidence against noninhibitory accounts (but see also Perfect et al., 2004, for a critique of the cue independence procedure).",

Specifically, they suggest that it is the retrieval attempt, and not the retrieval per se, that induces the forgetting of competing information. Even when the participants were provided with retrieval practice cues that precluded the successful retrieval of a category member, studied exemplars associated with that category became less recallable than they would have been otherwise. This finding is consistent with an inhibitory account because RIF- if it is the product of a process in which interfering information is suppressed in order to facilitate the retrieval of target information- - should occur whether the eventual retrieval is successful or not.",

        "text": "In contrast, interference- based noninhibitory accounts of RIF seem to demand that  $\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}+$  items be strengthened in order for RIF to be observed. It could be argued, however, that the participants did generate something during the impossible retrieval practice phase and that these generations- despite their not conforming to the cues- - nonetheless resulted in blocking the future recall of  $\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}-$  items. Although this conjecture cannot be ruled out completely by the present data, the trend suggesting that the participants who recorded fewer responses during impossible retrieval practice demonstrated greater RIF appears to argue against it. An inhibitory account of this finding might be that once participants do generate a response, they cease further retrieval attempts, thus preventing additional RIF.",

        "text": "Another finding of theoretical interest, given MacLeod and Macrae's (2001) finding that RIF effects may dissipate within  $24\\mathrm{h}$  is that the RIF effect remained after an additional week's delay. Because the same material was tested at both delays in the present experiment, however, the observed RIF after a week could be a kind of testing effect:  $\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}-$  items were recalled less often than the Nrp items during the initial test and may, therefore, have benefited less from an additional retrieval event. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the effect of retrieval practice on nonpracticed items remained at a week's delay, even if mediated by differing recall rates on the intermediate test. That is, by affecting what information can and cannot be recalled in the near future, RIF might dictate which information also benefits most from subsequent learning and rehearsal. As such, even if the inhibition caused by RIF is relatively short- lived, the effects of that temporary inhibition could potentially be very long lasting.",
