In 12 experiments, however, participants who were told they would be allowed to study a list of word pairs between 1 and 4 times and then take a cued- recall test predicted little or no learning across trials, notwithstanding their large increases in actual learning. When queried directly, the participants espoused the belief that studying results in learning, but they showed little evidence of that belief in the actual task. These findings, when combined with A. Koriat, R. A. Bjork, L. Sheffer, and S. K. Bar's (2004) research on judgments of forgetting, suggest a stability bias in human memory—that is, a tendency to assume that the accessibility of one's memories will remain relatively stable over time rather than benefiting from future learning or suffering from future forgetting."

Such an understanding provides a basis for judgments about what one is likely to remember later and provides a foundation for choosing activities that will create lasting memories. Understanding the value of deep processing (Craik & Lockhart, 1972; Craik & Tulving, 1975), for example, can make everyday tasks like remembering a shopping list easier (even though, in general, people do not fully appreciate the benefits of deep processing; see Bieman- Copland & Charness, 1994; Matvey, Dunlosky, Shaw, Parks, & Hertzog, 2002; Pressley, Levin, & Ghatala, 1984; Shaughnessy, 1981; Shaw & Craik, 1989). Gaining an understanding of the processes and activities that support learning is especially important for students, who must constantly make decisions about how and when to study (e.g., Kornell & Bjork, 2007)."

Memory monitoring involves making judgments about specific memories—for example, making a confidence judgment after answering a question. Memory monitoring plays a basic role in how memory is used. Depending on the question one is asked (e.g., what is your name, what did you eat for breakfast 2 years ago yesterday), for example, one can answer readily, with trepidation, vaguely, or not at all, based on monitoring one's memory (e.g., Goldsmith, Koriat, & Weinberg- Eliezer, 2002). Again, students, in particular, must monitor their learning to decide what information they need to continue studying and what they can leave behind (see, e.g., Kornell & Metcalfe, 2006)."

People are relatively—though not completely—insensitive to the amount they have studied (Koriat, Sheffer, & Ma'ayan, 2002), to what aspect of the studied material will be tested (Benjamin, Bjork, & Schwartz, 1998), and to when the test will occur (Koriat, Bjork, Sheffer, & Bar, 2004). They fail to recognize how much easier problems seem if one has already been shown the answer (e.g., Kelley & Jacoby, 1996). They also fail to appreciate the benefits of a number of interventions that increase the efficiency of learning, including spacing study trials as opposed to massing them together (i.e., the spacing effect; Baddeley & Longman, 1978; Dunlosky & Nelson,"

There is wide support for the view that metacognitive judgments are not based on direct access to memory traces but instead rely on inferential processes grounded in a variety of internal and external cues (Schwartz et al., 1997). According to Koriat's (1997) cue- utilization framework of metacognitive judgments, for example, there are three categories of metacognitive cues that guide judgments of learning (JOLs): extrinsic cues, intrinsic cues, and mnemonic cues. Extrinsic cues comprise external influences on memory, such as the nature of the encoding and retrieval context (e.g., the study situation and the test situation) or the amount of time that the to- be- learned information is made available for study. People often fail to appreciate extrinsic cues, which causes a variety of metacognitive illusions. Intrinsic cues, which people usually do appreciate, include characteristics of the to- be- learned information itself—for example, whether the two words in a word pair are related. Mnemonic cues, which people rely on heavily, are based on one's own internal memory state—for example, whether one can recall the answer to a question (T. O. Nelson & Dunlosky, 1991) and the fluency with which the answer comes to mind (Benjamin et al., 1998)."

Theory- based processes depend on a person's metacognitive beliefs—that is, a person's theory, or mental model, of how memory works (e.g., the belief that studying results in learning). Experience- based processes are cued by properties of the items themselves, such as their associability and concreteness, as well as internal cues, such as the fluency with which a response comes to mind. External factors, such as delay to test, do not affect experience- based processes. Theory- based processes are thought to be deliberate, in that they require thinking of and applying a theory of memory, whereas experienced- based processes are thought to arise automatically. In the cue- utilization framework, extrinsic cues often guide theory- based processes, whereas intrinsic and mnemonic cues guide experience- based processes."

Participants predicted significant forgetting only when the concept of forgetting was made salient—as, for example, when a given participant was asked to make item- by- item predictions for various retention intervals across items, in which case their predictions were quite accurate. That is, participants' predictions were sensitive to forgetting when the retention interval was manipulated within- participants, which activated the concept of forgetting, but were insensitive to forgetting when the retention interval was manipulated between participants."

That hypothesis was supported by a final experiment in which participants were asked to predict the number of items they would forget, instead of the number they would remember, which, by making the concept of forgetting salient, resulted in predictions that were sensitive to retention interval (though not as sensitive as was actual recall)."

A prediction of learning (POL) differs from a JOL by requiring a judgment of the amount one will learn as a result of future study opportunities, whereas a JOL requires assessing the amount one has learned by virtue of past study opportunities. (Note that a POL is actually closer, in one sense, to being a JOL than is a JOL: It is a judgment about the amount that a memory will change—that is, the amount of learning that will occur—given future study opportunities.) People often give higher JOLs to items that they have studied more (e.g., Metcalfe & Finn, 2008) because people have stronger memories for those items at the time of the judgment. We investigated whether people would also give higher POLs for items that they would be allowed to study more in the future."

Participants' predictions were remarkably accurate: In the words of the author, \"increases in predicted recall scores for both young and old as a function of longer hypothetical presentation times mirrored increases in actual recall that accompanied longer presentations\" (Coyne, 1985, p. 148). These results suggest that people can make accurate POLs, although the fact that the amount of study time was the only basis for the judgments was somewhat unrealistic and might have created a demand characteristic."

This finding is referred to as the underconfidence with practice effect. In a typical study, participants go through a series of study and test cycles and predict, for each studied item, the likelihood they will be able to recall that item during the subsequent test cycle (see, e.g., Koriat, Sheffer, & Ma'ayan, 2002). The JOLs during the first study cycle typically exhibit overconfidence (i.e., predicted recall is higher than actual recall), but that overconfidence switches to underconfidence on subsequent study and test cycles. People seem to make their JOLs during the second and subsequent trials by predicting that they will do as well as they did on the previous test (test performance being a relatively strong mnemonic cue), but in so doing, they fail to appreciate that the second study trial, as well as the first test, are important learning events (Finn & Metcalfe, 2007). This finding illustrates another case in which people underappreciate external influences (i.e., studying and practice) on memory."

One understandable reaction to that question might be to ask, how could it not be the case that participants would predict better recall given more study opportunities? There are two principal answers to that question. One is that people may indeed greatly undervalue the benefits of additional study. A second possibility is that people may hold the metacognitive belief that studying results in learning but that the application of that belief may be blocked by experience- based processes during the study of a given word pair. That is, a focus on intrinsic factors that influence subsequent recall, such the strength of cue- target associations, may block access to the role of extrinsic factors, such as the number of study and test trials. It should be the case that making the concept of studying salient should make participants' predictions more sensitive to the number of study opportunities—just as making the concept of forgetting salient resulted in more accurate predictions of forgetting (Koriat et al., 2004)."

The number of study and test cycles, which was manipulated on a between- participants basis, was between 1 and 4. During the first study cycle, participants were asked to predict, for each pair, their performance on the last test that they were scheduled to take (which was Test 1, 2, 3, or 4). Thus the conditions were ST, STST, STSTST, and STSTSTST. In Experiment 2, there was only one test, which was preceded by between 1 and 4 study trials (that is, ST, SST, SSST, and SSSST). We expected that removing intervening tests, in Experiment 2, would make salient the number of study opportunities and, thus, the idea that performance should increase across tests. In Experiment 2, we also included a second phase, after participants had completed the criterion test, in which participants were asked to predict how they would do if they did the experiment again with a new set of items."

The second change was that after the participants took the test they were asked to complete a second phase of the experiment in which, after being asked to imagine that they would participate in the experiment again with a new set of items, the participants were asked to predict the number of items they would remember after studying either 1 or 4 times."

During Phase 1 (left panel), participants completed 1, 2, 3, or 4 study trials per item (between participants) followed by a test trial. They were asked, during the first study trial on each item, to predict their accuracy on the test. Half of the items were easy, and half were hard. During Phase 2 (right panel), participants made aggregate predictions—that is, predictions of how many items they would recall on a 0–24 scale—assuming they would do the experiment again with new items. The data in the right panel are plotted as a function of the condition to which the participant was assigned during Phase 1 (abscissa) and the trial (1 or 4) for which he or she made predictions for during Phase 2. Error bars represent 1 standard error of the mean. "

Actual recall increased significantly between Test 1 and Test 4 in both experiments (by an average of 33 percentage points), but despite our expectations, predicted recall did not increase significantly in either experiment (the average increase was 3 percentage points). These results reflect a stability bias in human memory: Participants predicted little difference between their current memory state and their future memory state, regardless of the amount of studying that would be allowed in the future. Participants were highly sensitive to item difficulty, an intrinsic cue, but in support of the distinction between theory- based metacognitive judgments and experience- based metacognitive judgments, they were not sensitive to the amount that they would be allowed to study, an extrinsic cue."

Because aggregate judgments are not made about individual items, we predicted that item difficulty, an intrinsic cue, would exert less control than it did in Experiments 1 and 2. We expected that being released from the control of an intrinsic cue might allow an extrinsic cue, the number of study opportunities, to exert more control. Consistent with that interpretation, aggregate judgments have been shown to be less subject to overconfidence than are item- by- item judgments (Griffin & Tversky, 1992; Koriat et al., 2002; Mazzoni & Nelson, 1995). In addition, participants did not experience learning the items when making aggregate judgments, so we expected them to rely less on the experienced- based processes that seemed dominant in the previous experiments and to rely more on theory- based predictions instead. For these reasons, we expected participants might be less subject to underconfidence in learning when making aggregate judgments."

In Experiments 5 and 6, we made the study manipulation more salient. Participants were asked to make predictions on a within- participant basis. They were not asked to make multiple predictions for a given item (but see Experiments 9 and 10); instead, for each item, they were asked to make a prediction for one of the four tests. The predicted- for test was selected randomly on each trial (see Figure 4). This procedure made the manipulation of study opportunities unmistakably salient. Under similar within- participant conditions—in the context of predicting forgetting, rather than learning—Koriat et al.'s (2004) participants accurately predicted that they would forget with time."

Experiment 6 was similar to Experiment 5, but the materials were word pairs whose difficulty was relatively homogeneous, which we thought would make item differences less salient, giving more prominence to the study manipulation and thereby increasing prediction accuracy. In Experiment 6, we also asked participants, after they had completed the test, to imagine doing the experiment again with a new set of word pairs and to predict how they would do on either Test 1 or Test 4."

The materials in Experiment 5, which were a mix of easy and difficult word pairs, varied with respect to item difficulty, an intrinsic cue that has been shown to influence metacognitive judgments more than do extrinsic cues, such as the number of study trials (Koriat, 1997; Koriat et al., 2004). We hypothesized that in the previous experiments, item difficulty may have been a strong cue that overshadowed the manipulation of study and test opportunities. In Experiment 6, we used a relatively homogeneous set of difficult word pairs. As in Experiment 2, we also asked participants, after they had completed the final test, how they thought they would do if they did the experiment again with a new set of items."

They were then asked, on a between- participants basis, to predict the number of items they would answer correctly on either Test 1 or Test 4. Because the study manipulation was within- participants during the first phase of the experiment, the design of the second phase was a between- participants design with two between- participant conditions: Participants were asked to predict for Test 1 or Test 4."

During Phase 1 (left panel), participants completed four study and test cycles. They were asked, during the first study trial on each item, to predict their accuracy on Test 1, 2, 3, or 4. The test for which the participant made the prediction was assigned randomly on a within-participant basis. During Phase 2 (right panel), participants made aggregate predictions—that is, predictions of how many items they would recall on a 0–24 scale—assuming they would do the experiment again with new items, given either 1 or 4 study and test trials (between participants). Error bars represent 1 standard error of the mean."

We expected the within- participants manipulation to make the number of study opportunities salient and, therefore, make people predict that they would learn over time. Such a finding would have replicated Koriat et al.'s (2004) finding that people predict they will forget when the retention interval is manipulated within- participants. Contrary to our expectations, however, our participants predicted that they would learn very little by studying. Although participants predicted a significant, if small increase in learning across trials in Experiment 5, they did not predict a significant increase in Experiment 6. Once again, these results are consistent with a stability bias in human memory—that is, participants acted as though their memories would not change in the future, regardless of how much they would be allowed to study."

At issue was whether people learn from experience that studying results in learning—that is, would the participants' experience during the initial experiment, in which they learned and then took a test, lead participants to make accurate aggregate predictions. When the initial experiment only involved one test (Experiment 2), the subsequent predictions of performance on Test 1 and Test 4 were equivalent; when the initial experiment involved four study and test cycles (Experiment 6), participants predicted that they would learn by studying, although they underestimated their learning ability. Thus, being tested during the initial experiment seems to have been a critical factor in allowing participants to recognize the benefits of studying and being tested. In both experiments, participants were overconfident in their memory abilities and underconfident in their learning ability."

We expected that asking participants about forgetting might make them mindful of the ways their memories change, including the fact that studying results in a resistance to forgetting and, thereby, make them more sensitive to the study manipulation. Koriat et al. (2004) found that participants, on a between- participants basis, did predict forgetting—though not to the extent of actual forgetting—when they were asked to predict forgetting rather than remembering. They concluded that making the concept of forgetting salient, by asking about forgetting, activated participants' knowledge that forgetting happens over time. Although we did not manipulate retention interval—or by extension forgetting—we reasoned that thinking about forgetting might nonetheless make participants think about external influences on memory, including the positive effect of studying on learning."

Predictions of learning made about difficult items were often quite accurate on Test 2. This pattern emerged in Experiments 2, 5, and 6 and, to a lesser degree, in Experiment 1. (It also emerged in Experiments 9 and 12. ) It is unclear what led to this outcome—we presume participants' overconfidence in their current memory states was cancelled out by their underconfidence in their learning ability—but the consistency of the results makes Experiment 7 stand out. Participants in Experiment 7 clearly overestimated their Test 2 performance, indicating again that framing the prediction in terms of forgetting increased predictions. (The only other experiment that could have shown the pattern but did not was Experiment 8, for reasons that become clear below.)"

The participants seemed to hold the belief, corresponding to a stability bias in human memory, that learning is characterized by a kind of inertia: Given a current memory state, our participants acted as though their memories would remain relatively unchanged (although they did predict a small amount of learning), despite external influences and direct personal evidence to the contrary. We return to this point in the General Discussion."

That is, does the stability bias apply to the past? If it does, then after completing four study and test trials, when their test performance has reached a high level, participants should overestimate their level of performance on Test 1—this is, they should rate it closer to their current memories than it actually was."

Please enter a number from 0 to 24. ” In the judge- Test 4 condition, the instruction were adjusted so that they asked about Test 4 (i.e., the last test).

Instead, they were asked to predict their performance on the last test they were asked to complete, which, depending on the participant's condition, was either Test 1, Test 2, Test 3, or Test 4. Thus, for example, a participant in the second condition predicted how they would do on Test 2 during the first study phase and again during the second study phase. By asking for predictions of future learning, we were able to test the prediction that the UWP effect results from a failure to appreciate the benefits of studying."

This shift was consistent with the standard UWP effect, and it was reasonable (if inappropriate) for the STST group, given that group's overconfidence on List 1. It is, however, ironic that by adjusting downward, the STSTST and STSTSTST groups became even more underconfident on the second trial than they were on the first trial; for example, the STSTSTST group, after being 41 percentage points underconfident on Trial 1, adjusted the predictions so that they were 43 percentage points underconfident on Trial 2. It appears that our participants assumed their Test 2 performance would be similar to their Test 1 performance and, therefore, adjusted their predictions downward, all the while neglecting to consider the influence of the upcoming study and test trials."

Although we did not explicitly tell them how many items they answered correctly at the end of each test, the results of Experiment 11 suggest that participants could report accurately how well they had done on previous tests. Thus, in Experiment 12, participants could have noticed that their recall rates had improved a great deal between Test 1 and Test 2, surmised that those rates would probably continue to improve on future trials, and adjusted their POLs on Trial 3 accordingly. They did not, however, appear to make such an adjustment. The STSTST group's actual performance increased by 19 percentage points between Test 1 and Test 2, but between Test 2 and Test 3 that group's predicted performance increased by 9 percentage points. Group 4's actual performance increased by 23 percentage points between Test 1 and Test 2, but between Test 2 and Test 3 that group's predicted performance—which, assuming a simple linear learning function, should have increased by 46 percentage points—increased by 13 percentage points. Moreover, Group 3 and Group 4 predicted similar increases in learning (9 and 13 percentage points, respectively), although Group 4 was expecting another study and test trial, and Group 3 was not.

People are thought to make judgments based on the items themselves during the first study trial, and then shift, on later trials, to making judgments based, at least in part, on how they did on the previous test (Finn & Metcalfe, 2007). In doing so, they shift from using intrinsic cues to using mnemonic cues (Koriat, 1997; Koriat et al., 2002). The amount people are allowed to study between the previous test and the upcoming test, however, is an additional, extrinsic cue, and as the current findings suggest, it is a cue to which people are surprisingly insensitive. Thus, the cause of the UWP effect may essentially be a stability bias: People base their predictions on their previous test performance and discount, or even ignore, the benefits of the studying and testing that have taken place, or will take place, between the previous test and future tests."

Surprisingly—and unlike Koriat et al.'s (2004) findings—even when a within- participants experimental design was used to draw participants' attention to the number of study opportunities provided for each item, our participants again regularly failed to draw on their knowledge that studying aids learning (Figures 5, 6, and 7). When participants had experienced the change in their own "

That the two types of judgment appear to differ in some fundamental ways is illustrated by the fact that participants in the current experiments were simultaneously overconfident in their current memory states (when predicting test 1 performance) and vastly underconfident in the amount their memories would change as a result of studying. Moreover, unlike predicting the effects of future study, prior research has illustrated that participants' JOLs do vary as a function of the amount of studying they have already done (e.g., Metcalfe & Finn, 2008)."

There is only one basis for predicting future memory: metacognitive beliefs. In the absence of metacognitive beliefs, neither the item itself nor one's memory of it is diagnostic of how one's memory will change in the future.

That is, a computer does not form stronger memories by being exposed to the same information multiple times, nor does it forget over time. A computer either \"knows\" something or it does not. Unlike a human, a computer's memory is decidedly stable. To a surprising degree, the participants in the current experiments (see also Koriat et al., 2004) acted as though their memories worked roughly the same stable way. In reality, of course, human memory is a complex, cumulative process with characteristics very different from those of a computer's memory (Bjork, 1989) as the progressive increases in performance across tests in the current experiments demonstrated."

Predictions about learning differed, however, from predictions about forgetting in two important ways. First, our participants failed to apply their theories of learning even when learning was made very salient, whereas Koriat et al.'s (2004) participants accessed their concept of forgetting when forgetting was made salient. Second, people's beliefs about learning appear to be less accurate than their beliefs about forgetting. We discuss each of these differences below."

The UWP effect refers to the finding that people are generally overconfident on the first study trial but shift to underconfidence thereafter (Koriat et al., 2002). Previous explanations have suggested that the UWP effect occurs because on Trial 2 (and beyond), people make predictions based on mnemonic cues such as their success on the previous test (Finn & Metcalfe, 2007). They become underconfident, the theory goes, because their memories improve between the previous test and the upcoming test—as a result of the previous test itself as well as the intervening study trial—but they fail to adjust their judgments upward to account for that learning. The current experiments, especially Experiment 12, support that conclusion. The participants in Experiment 12, for example, who were asked to predict their performance on Test 4, were not only radically underconfident, but they even adjusted their predictions downward on Trial 2 to match their relatively low Test 1 performance—which in turn, made their predictions even more underconfident on Trial 2 than they were on trial 1."

If, however, JOLs are broken down into two processes inherent in UWP predictions—estimating one's level of learning at the time of the last test and estimating the amount learning has changed since that test—it seems quite possible that people remain overconfident, or at least fairly well calibrated, with respect to their memories as they were at the time of the last test but become underconfident in the amount they have learned since then—that is, they fall victim to a stability bias in human memory. Thus, at a process level, we suggest that perhaps UWP reflects calibration or even overconfidence in one's memory as it was when last tested, coupled with underconfidence in one's ability to learn."

Our findings and the idea of a stability bias in human memory are reminiscent of the fundamental attribution error, a term coined by Lee Ross (1977) to refer to the assumption that others' actions reflect internal characteristics and not the control exerted by the environment. Although people ignore the situation when making attributions about others, they take it into account when making attributions about themselves (Jones & Nisbett, 1972). One way to avoid the fundamental attribution error is to take another's perspective, but perspective taking is another fundamentally difficult, nonautomatic task."

The importance of being able to estimate the potential benefits of future study episodes when planning future study episodes is obvious. The difficulty of such decisions is illustrated by a study (Kornell & Bjork, 2008b) in which participants had to decide whether they wanted to leave a given flashcard in a stack of flashcards so that they could encounter it in the future, or drop it from future study and test trials. Being in control of the decision had a negative impact on participants' learning- that is, they did better when they were not allowed to drop any cards- because they underestimated the value of future study and test trials, especially on difficult items, and therefore dropped them too quickly."

But if a student fails to apply that belief, which the participants in our experiments did quite stubbornly, they may choose not to study because of a belief that doing so will have little effect on advancing them toward their goals."

Academic difficulties are only one of the many reasons students drop out, of course, and our findings, though suggestive, are far from proof that underestimating learning causes students to drop out (nor do they suggest a cure for the problem)."

The finding that people undervalue, or place no value on, studying corresponds to the entity orientation, although the fact that all participants subscribed to the metacognitive belief that studying leads to learning corresponds to the incremental orientation."

An inaccurate mental model of how learning works will lead to counterproductive study decisions, and students whose model incorporates a stability bias—that is, an underestimation of their potential to learn and an overemphasis their current memory state—become susceptible not only to studying too little and giving up too quickly, but also to lowering, and/or failing to realize, their aspirations. Identifying our misconceptions about learning is a first step, but only a first step, toward remedying those misconceptions."
