But what happens when one cannot answer a test question—does an unsuccessful retrieval attempt impede future learning or enhance it? The authors examined this question using materials that ensured that retrieval attempts would be unsuccessful. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were asked fictional general- knowledge questions (e.g., \"What peace treaty ended the Calumet War?\"). In Experiments 3–6, participants were shown a cue word (e.g., whale) and were asked to guess a weak associate (e.g., mammal); the rare trials on which participants guessed the correct response were excluded from the analyses. In the test condition, participants attempted to answer the question before being shown the answer; in the read- only condition, the question and answer were presented together. Unsuccessful retrieval attempts enhanced learning with both types of materials. These results demonstrate that retrieval attempts enhance future learning; they also suggest that taking challenging tests—instead of avoiding errors—may be one key to effective learning."

It is, therefore, a broad goal of instruction to foster such active involvement, and testing is one means of doing so. The dynamics of tests as learning events have long been of interest to investigators (see, e.g., Allen, Mahler, & Estes, 1969; Bjork, 1975, 1988; Donaldson, 1971; Gates, 1917; Hogan & Kintsch, 1971; Izawa, 1970; Landauer & Bjork, 1978; Landauer & Eldridge, 1967; Spitzer, 1939; Tulving, 1967; Whitten & Bjork, 1977; Young, 1971), and that interest has been recently reinvigorated by demonstrations that testing has substantial benefits for educationally realistic materials and retention intervals (e.g., Carrier & Pashler, 1992; Glover, 1989; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a, 2006b)."

First, there is abundant evidence that successfully retrieving information from memory increases the likelihood that the information in question can be recalled successfully at a later time (for a recent review, see Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). This increase is considerably greater than when the information is merely presented. Related to that fact, successful tests appear to retard the forgetting that would otherwise occur (e.g., Hogan & Kintsch, 1971; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b). Tests also have metacognitive value for the learner: They allow for a more accurate assess "

What, though, is the effect of an unsuccessful retrieval attempt? If successful tests enhance learning, do unsuccessful tests impede learning—or do they also enhance learning? The literature supports predictions of either outcome. The foremost reason to expect unsuccessful tests to have negative consequences is the idea of errorless learning—that is, the idea that learning is most effective when errors are minimized. Errorless learning has had a long and influential history in psychology (e.g., Guthrie, 1952; Skinner, 1958). Although it is an idea that derives mainly from findings in studies of nonhuman animal learning, it has influenced suggestions about best practices for educators as well (for a discussion, see Pashler, Zarow, & Triplett, 2003), and it is used frequently and successfully in patient populations (e.g., Evans et al., 2000)."

Moreover, there is direct empirical evidence that a brief, unsuccessful cued- recall test followed by a presentation can hinder memory, versus a presentation not preceded by a test (Cunningham & Anderson, 1968).

First, in educational settings, students who are asked questions about a topic before they begin to study it learn more from the subsequent study opportunity than do students who are shown the same questions but are not required to answer them and it is important to note that such prequestions are beneficial even if the student's initial answer is incorrect (Pressley, Tanenbaum, McDaniel, & Wood, 1990; Richland, Kornell, & Kao, 2009). Second, increasing the delay between successive tests increases error rates during learning, but, if feedback is provided, it also enhances learning as measured on a delayed test (Pashler et al., 2003). This effect derives from the benefits of spacing—that is, the benefit of spacing repeated learning events apart instead of massing them together (e.g., Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006; Dempster, 1996; Glenberg, 1979)—but also reflects an apparent lack of harm caused by errors. Similarly, forcing students to guess when they are tested, which greatly increases error rates, does not appear to diminish performance on a later test (Pashler, Rohrer, Cepeda, & Carpenter, 2007)."

The authors pointed out, however, that the advantage of generation may have occurred because semantic generation succeeded (i.e., participants generated the semantic concept avoid) even if they failed to generate the surface, lexical features of avoid.

In the first two experiments, participants initially studied 40 trivia questions, 20 of which were fictional and 20 of which were nonfictional. There were two conditions during the initial study phase. In the read- only condition, the question and answer were presented together; in the test condition, the question was presented alone for several seconds—and participants were asked to try to produce the answer—before the answer was revealed. Experiments 1 and 2 differed only in the duration of the read- only condition. In Experiment 1, the answer was displayed for an equal amount of time in the read- only and test conditions. In Experiment 2, the total trial time in the two conditions was equal. Figure 1 summarizes the procedure used during study trials in all six experiments. After the study phase, there was a 5- min distractor task and then all 40 items were tested. Experiments 3 and 4 were procedurally identical to Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, with one major difference: The materials were 60 weak associates (e.g., skyscraper- tower); in the test condition, participants were presented with the cue and asked to produce the target. Experiment 5 was identical to Experiment 4, except that the delay between study and test averaged "

The participant will have little chance of thinking of, or even coming close to, the correct fictional answer (Albert), in part because it is fictional, but also in part because names are somewhat arbitrary. The best the participant can do is to randomly guess a name, knowing that it is incorrect. Just as important is what happens after the answer is presented: If one knows nothing about the fictional Albert, it remains difficult to do semantic processing of the answer."

A cue like train, by contrast, may not elicit the correct response (caboose) but it will likely elicit some response (e.g., track). If retrieving an incorrect answer causes that answer, instead of the correct answer, to be retrieved on a subsequent test (e.g., Evans et al., 2000; Marsh et al., 2007), then in the experiments that follow—which we expect to increase the retrieval of errors—the benefit of unsuccessful tests should be diminished or eliminated."

In the present experiments, on test trials, participants often generated incorrect responses from memory before being presented with the correct answer. If generation prevents forgetting, then the incorrect responses that participants generated during study should have remained relatively intact over time, whereas the correct responses that were shown subsequently should have been forgotten more quickly. Those incorrect responses would be expected to cause confusion and interference and decrease the rate of correct responding on the final test. This line of reasoning suggests that the testing advantage should have been smaller after "

In experiments on the generation effect, Slamecka and Katsaiti (1987) found a generation effect using mixed lists (i.e., lists including generate and read- only items) but no generation effect in a between- list design. They concluded, \"The generation effect of recall is an artifact of selective displaced rehearsal that strengthens generated items at the expense of read items\" (Slamecka & Katsaiti, 1987, p. 589). The same reasoning could be applied to Experiments 1- 5: It is possible that tested items were rehearsed during the presentation of read- only items; in addition, tested items might have been encoded more distinctly than read- only items were. If so, the mixing of read- only and test items could account for the testing advantage, and separating such "

The results also suggest that, in situations where tests and study opportunities are interleaved or testing is followed by feedback, the benefits of testing go beyond the benefits attributable to the learning that happens on successful tests. With respect to theoretical explanations of the testing effect, this finding is important because it demonstrates that the benefits of testing are not limited to the benefits of successful retrieval; rather, for a theory to fully explain the benefits of tests, it needs to explain the benefits of retrieval failure as well as the benefits of retrieval success. Successful tests obviously play a role, and perhaps a unique role- the findings do not imply that unsuccessful tests and successful tests are equally effective or that they are necessarily effective for the same reasons- but unsuccessful tests can also have a positive effect on long- term retention."

As the authors pointed out, however, the generation failures were often actually successful generations of the searched- for semantic memory, accompanied by a failure to retrieve the correct word; thus, the semantic memories were accessible during the criterion test. The current findings extend previous results by showing that when retrievals are indeed unsuccessful and study time is precisely controlled, unsuccessful retrievals enhance learning."

First, attempting to retrieve information from memory may result in deep processing at retrieval (Bjork, 1975; Carpenter & DeLosh, 2006), thereby producing benefits similar to the effects of deep processing at encoding (e.g., Craik & Watkins, 1973). Unsuccessful retrieval might promote deep processing as well, initially of the question and information related to the question and then of the answer once the answer is presented. For example, when faced with the fictional question \"What is the name of the sailor who took the first solo voyage around Cape Evergreen?\" a participant might activate concepts related to sailing, self- reliance, cold weather, endurance, and other firsts (e.g., the first person to scale Mount Everest). The attempt to retrieve the answer may enhance the activation of these related concepts, which may, in turn, create a fertile context for encoding the answer when it is presented. The semantic processing of the answer itself may have "

For example, when faced with the cue pond, participants might think of features of ponds, such as water, green, and creeks; when presented with frog, they might think of features of frogs (such as hopping), as well as frogs paired with ponds (such as imagining a green frog against the green background of a pond). Thus the current experiments provide support for explanations of the testing effect in which testing enhances deep processing, which, in turn, enhances learning."

This explanation may seem inconsistent with the benefits of unsuccessful tests because searching memory in vain for an answer could strengthen retrieval routes that are actually dead ends, but it could be that exploring incorrect retrieval routes actually weakens, rather than strengthens, those routes. Carrier and Pashler (1992), for example, proposed that testing is a way of generating and then suppressing errors (for an interpretation of such dynamics in the context of connectionist models, see McClelland & Rumelhart, 1986). Unsuccessful tests may be even better than successful tests at culling inappropriate retrieval routes, making future recall easier. The fact that unsuccessful tests enhance learning can be seen as support for the proposal that suppression of errors is an important mechanism underlying the benefit of tests."

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Education recently released a guide for instructors that voiced the concern teachers often express: \"Is it harmful for a learner to produce an answer that has a high likelihood of being an error? If so, should efforts be taken to discourage production of incorrect responses?\" (Pashler, Bain, et al., 2007, p. 22). Most teachers would probably cringe at the thought of asking a student a question and withholding the answer—while knowing that the student had never been given a chance to learn it—as we did in the current experiments.
