Recall tests, however, measure the number of items that are above a recall threshold, not memory strength per se. According to the model proposed in this paper, tests without feedback produce bifurcated item distributions: Retrieved items become stronger, but non- retrieved items remain weak, resulting in a gap between the two classes of items. Restudying items, on the other hand, strengthens all items, though to a lesser degree than does retrieval. These differing outcomes can make tested items appear to be forgotten more slowly than are restudied items—even if all items are forgotten at the same rate—because the test- induced bifurcation leaves items either well above or well below threshold. We review prior evidence and present three new experiments designed to test the bifurcation interpretation."

If University Tech has weeder Econ and University State does not, Tech will graduate fewer Econ majors, but they will have more extensive training. If all of the Econ majors from both schools were to take the same comprehensive Econ exam upon graduation, the total number passing the exam might be greater at State (given its larger number of Econ majors), but if the same students took the same exam 5 years later, the advantage might be reversed, because many of the more highly selected and well- trained Tech students might still be able to pass the test, whereas many of the State students might fall below the threshold for passing."

Tests help strong items a lot, but weaker items that cannot be retrieved on the test \"drop out.\" Restudying, by contrast, helps all of the items, but not as much as successful retrieval helps retrieved items. In this article, we argue that one reason why tests appear to prevent subsequent forgetting is because tests bifurcate distributions of to- be- learned items into strong and weak items. As time passes and all items become less accessible, restudied items pass below the final- test threshold before the stronger tested items do so. This bifurcation can produce the appearance of differential forgetting rates even if restudied and tested items are forgotten at the same actual rate as measured by loss of retrieval strength."

Such strengths may not be measurable directly, and may not be meaningful in isolation- because retrieval success depends on what cues are available at the time of retrieval, whether to- be- recalled items were recently primed, and so forth- but all else being equal, models assume that items with more strength are more retrievable. For current purposes, we assume that (a) memory strengths of different items lie on a continuum and (b) an item can be recalled if its current strength in memory is above some recall threshold."

Instead, they measure whether that item's strength is high enough to surpass a threshold for recall.

To illustrate, assume we have conducted an experiment with 10 items in each of two conditions, where the memory strengths in Condition 1 are 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 0 on an arbitrary 0- 100 scale, whereas the strengths in Condition 2 are 100, 100, 100, 100, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40.

In the control condition, the items are studied, but then are not restudied or tested before some final criterion test. The results of many different experiments (for a comprehensive review, see Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b) have demonstrated that an initial test not only enhances recall on a later test- as measured against such a control condition- but often also yields better recall on the final test than does the restudy condition.

For the items in set A that are successfully retrieved, the act of retrieval serves as a potent learning event, and the memory strengths of these items are boosted by a large amount. Items that are not retrieved are not boosted at all (see Spellman & Bjork, 1992), at least under ordinary circumstances. Moreover, they are already below threshold, by virtue of not being recallable, and they gradually drift toward being less and less memorable owing to the inexorable process of forgetting. Thus, there are two classes of items in item set A: items that get a big memory boost because they are retrieved and items that are not boosted at all. That is, tests bifurcate item distributions. The items in set B, on the other hand, are all presented for restudy, which means that they all get a boost, but not as large a boost as the retrieved items in set A. They end up normally distributed, with the resulting distribution falling between the two sections of the test- bifurcated distribution in set A."

Fig. 1 is a simplified (even crude) model that does not reflect the complicated dynamics of learning and forgetting. This model is conservative, and perhaps biased against our hypothesis, in at least two ways. First, we assume that all items are forgotten at the same rate, but well- known information may be forgotten more slowly than less well- known information (Bjork & Bjork, 1992). As a result, tested items may be forgotten more slowly than restudied items, but not because of the benefits of testing per se. Instead, it may be that tests, like other manipulations"

Feedback may not affect successfully retrieved items (e.g., Pashler, Cepeda, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2005). But feedback can have a large effect on non- retrieved items: Instead of essentially dropping out, these items gain strength. Indeed, evidence reviewed below suggests that unsuccessfully attempting to retrieve an item, and then receiving feedback, results in more learning than does restudying the same item without making a retrieval attempt (e.g., Kornell, Hays, & Bjork, 2009). If non- retrieved items benefit sufficiently from feedback, then feedback may reduce or prevent bifurcation."

Participants recalled more items on the test at the end of the SSST condition (39%) than the STTT condition (30%). Yet a week later, recall performance was the same in the two conditions (20%).

For example, Roediger and Karpicke (2006a) uncovered one of the most dramatic demonstrations of the test- delay interaction. They asked participants to study short passages on tea otters or the sun. In their second experiment, they found that in the SSSS condition recall dropped from over 80% correct 5 min after participants studied to 40% a week later. In the STTT condition, the drop was from 70% to 60%. The sheer size of this interaction is impressive; as a proportion of the information participants recalled after 5 min, participants in the delayed SSSS conditions forgot 52% of the information, whereas participants in the STTT condition forgot only 14%.

For example, Runquist (1983) asked participants in his second experiment to study 24 word pairs and then tested them initially on 12 of the pairs. He then gave them a criterion test either immediately or after a delay. Recall accuracy declined more, as a function of delay, for items that were not tested than it did for items that were tested. He concluded that \"the difference between tested and untested items increased with longer retention intervals\" (p. 641). Runquist (1986) found similar outcomes, concluding that the results \"point to the importance of retrieval operations in the attenuation of forgetting\" (p. 65). As Carpenter, Pasller, Wixted, and Vul (2008) point out, however, Runquist (1983, 1986) only analyzed items from the test condition that had been answered correctly during the study phase, whereas he analyzed all items from the restudy condition, introducing a item- selection effect that could explain the benefit of testing in his experiments, although not necessarily the test- delay interaction."

Even in the absence of bifurcation, though, item distributions can explain interactions when recall rates are very high. If almost all items are above threshold in both conditions, and the tested items are farther above threshold than are the studied items, then, as time passes, studied items should begin to cross below threshold before the tested items do so. Thus, even if forgetting rates were the same, differences in item distributions could produce a test- delay interaction. Moreover, adding a ninth study trial after a series of eight study trials probably had little marginal value in Toppino and Cohen's experiment. But adding a test on trial nine may have benefited learning substantially (in part because studying an item one can already recall has little value, but being tested on the same items is very valuable; Karpicke & Roediger, 2007, 2008). Thus, at the end of the study phase in Toppino and Cohen's experiment, the distribution of tested items was probably well above the distribution of studied items. In short, when performance levels are high- and thus, most items start out above threshold- and the distribution of tested items is significantly stronger than the distribution of studied items, a test- delay interaction can be expected even if the bifurcation of the distribution is relatively minimal."

In these studies, participants were typically trained via multiple cycles of studying and/or testing. The initial test cycles typically show less than perfect performance. When there are multiple tests per item, some items will be recalled successfully multiple times, creating high levels of memory strength, whereas others might only be recalled once. For example, if items in subset A were retrieved successfully four times and items in subset B were retrieved only once, the result could be a bifurcated distribution, with A items far stronger than B items, even though all items were eventually recalled. Thus, testing can produce bifurcation even if eventual performance is perfect."

Second, tests are not the only way distributions can be bifurcated. The bifurcation model predicts that bifurcating a distribution should appear to prevent forgetting even when no items are tested."

First, even if the pairs had not been studied previously, figuring out the answer involves recalling the association (e.g., between planet and earth) from semantic memory. Second, because the items were studied previously, pairs could be recalled based on the study phase in the Consonants condition (as they were in the Test condition). It is true that retrieval with consonants differed in some ways from retrieval without consonants, but it seems to us that the simplest explanation of the Consonant condition's benefits (described shortly) is that they were due to retrieval.

The interesting question has to do with the rate of forgetting in the Consonants condition. Would it look more like the Test condition or the Restudy condition? Again, there were two competing predictions. If retrieval prevents forgetting, the rate of forgetting in the Consonants condition should be similar to the rate of forgetting in the Test condition, because both involve retrieval. But we expected the rate of retrieval accuracy in the Consonants condition to be near perfect during the study phase, which would mean all items would be treated equally. Thus, according to the bifurcation model, the rate of forgetting in the Consonants condition and the Restudy condition should be about the same—and they should both differ from the Test condition."

It is worth noting that there are other ways of conceptualizing forgetting (e.g., as the proportion of items that were recalled on the immediate test that were lost by the time of the delayed test).We chose to use the subtraction/ANOVA method for two reasons; first, it is the measure of forgetting used most often in prior research. Second, it corresponds well to the idea, built into the bifurcation model, that it is important to consider the number of items above and below threshold."

This interpretation would support the theory that retrieval prevents forgetting. An alternate interpretation is that some amount of bifurcation did occur in the Consonant condition, where accuracy was not perfect (.89 and .94 during the two practice phases), and this bifurcation contributed to the non- significant difference in apparent forgetting."

The point was not to simulate the procedure of a testing experiment; it was to simulate the resulting distributions. The experiment included an initial pool of 80 word pairs.

In the other condition, twenty of the remaining 40 items were studied twice each and the other 20 items were not studied at all. The Study- 40 condition simulates a restudy condition in the sense that all items were all treated equally and their memory strengths were boosted by the roughly the same amount.

But there were two other retrieval conditions, the test- plus- feedback condition and the consonants condition, in which all items were treated more- or- less equally. Both of these conditions produced rates of forgetting comparable to that of the Copy condition and significantly greater than that of the Test condition (and both were superior to the Test condition overall). Thus, retrieval without bifurcation did not appear to prevent forgetting. In Experiment 3, we simulated the kind of distribution created by testing without feedback, and found the appearance of reduced forgetting, even though the learning phase of the experiment did not involve any retrieval."

The only methodological difference between the two conditions was that, during a mere 2 s after each trial, feedback was provided in the Test- plus- feedback condition but withheld in the Test condition. Thus, if educators and students want to take advantage of the testing effect, they should recognize that incorporating feedback plays an essential role in making tests beneficial (particularly after unsuccessful tests; see Hays, Kornell, & Bjork, 2010; Pashler et al., 2005).A corollary of this conclusion is that in many cases, tests without feedback are not an efficient way to study."

This analysis assumed that if some items are more retrievable than others at a given point in time, they are bound to be forgotten at a lower rate, even if the forgetting rates appear to be parallel, because eventually both functions will go to zero.

Furthermore, any actual difference between the Test- plus- feedback and Copy condition can be explained by the bifurcation model under the assumption that the value of a successful test plus feedback exceeds the value of an unsuccessful test plus feedback. If that assumption is valid, even tests with feedback will bifurcate item distributions, if less dramatically than tests without feedback. The apparent small difference in forgetting rate between the Test- plus- feedback and Copy conditions in Experiment 2, shown in Fig. 3, may reflect such a dynamic."

That is, after 20 items had been studied, studying 20 new items was equal in value to restudying the same 20 items again. Apparently, the second of two spaced study trials was just as valuable, at least in terms of apparent learning, as the first (for a review of the spacing effect, see Cepeda,Pashler,Vul,Wixted,& Rohrer,2006).It should be remembered, however, that the Study- 40 condition lost "

In the present experiments, test difficulty was manipulated by manipulating the retention interval between learning and a final test. Halamish and Bjork (in press) manipulated test difficulty in another way, based on test format (e.g. free recall versus cued- recall). Doing so produced the type of interaction found in the present experiments: Changing the test format was akin to changing the threshold for recall, and as the threshold became more stringent, initial testing became more advantageous, as compared to initial restudying."

For example, consider relearning. Relearning can be just as important as initial learning; because it happens so often, it can even be more important. Relearning is easier when an item is just below threshold than when it is very weak. The bifurcation model predicts that when average recall accuracy is higher among tested than restudied items, the restudied items that are below threshold will be stronger than the tested items that are below threshold. As a result, the restudied items will be easier to relearn than tested items. If, in a testing effect experiment, all items were restudied after a delay and then tested, instead of simply being tested after a delay, a relatively large number of previously restudied items could become recallable. Thus, the longterm advantage of test trials could turn into an advantage for presentation trials. In other words, the apparent"

These low- hanging fruit are easiest to move from below threshold to above threshold. But when one's goal is to master even the difficult items (e.g., if one intends to become fluent in a foreign language), the optimal strategy may be to focus on the most difficult items. Even if doing so is the worst strategy as measured by a relatively short- term recall test, it may be the best way to move all items above threshold permanently."

Bifurcated distributions affect apparent forgetting rates. They also appear to affect metacognitive ratings (Kimball & Metcalfe, 2003; Spellman & Bjork, 1992). Moreover, they might affect practical recommendations about ways to increase learning efficiency. Manipulations that result in the most items being above threshold at a given time produce the greatest recall accuracy at that time. But these manipulations do not necessarily produce the most overall memory strength. Memory strength, not recall accuracy at a particular time, is the key to preventing forgetting and promoting future learning."
