In Experiment 1, variability of input environments produced higher free recall performance than unchanged input environments. Experiment 2 showed improvements in cued recall when storage and test contexts matched, using a paradigm that unconfounded the variables of context mismatching and context change. In Experiment 3, recall of categories and recall of words within a category were better for same- context than different- context recall. In Experiment 4, subjects given identical input conditions showed strong effects of environmental context when given a free recall test, yet showed no main effects of context on a recognition test. The absence of an environmental context effect on recognition was replicated in Experiment 5, using a cued recognition task to control the semantic encodings of test words. In the discussion of these experiments, environmental context is compared with other types of context, and an attempt is made to identify the memory processes influenced by environmental context."

The particular concern of this article is whether the general environmental context in which an item is presented or tested can be conceptualized to function in the same fashion as contextual factors that have more obvious influences on the encoding of an item, such as the nature of surrounding items (Gartman & Johnson, 1972). A second concern of this article is to identify specific cognitive processes affected by the environmental context."

The type of context being referred to, however, is not always specified, and it is not empirically clear that all types of context play identical roles with respect to these mental phenomena. Bower states that context is made up of \"background external and interoceptive stimulation prevailing during presentation of the phasic experimental stimuli ... [plus the subject's] mental set\" (1972, p.93). Anderson and Bower add to the definition \"physical characteristics of an item's presentation, implicit associations to the items, and some cognitive elements representing the list in question\" (1974, p.409). To attribute an identical formal effect to all such aspects of an item's context may or may not turn out to be a valid speculative leap, but there is little in the way of empirical evidence that would argue for or against such a notion."

Elements of the environmental context include such things as the time of day, the building and room in which to- be- remembered items are presented, the appearance of the experimenter, and the sensory mode of the stimuli. Past studies of environmental context have found that recall and relearning performance improves if the subject is tested in his original learning environment, rather than a changed one (Reed, 1931; Smith & Guthrie, 1924), and that retroactive interference (RI) is reduced if interpolated learning occurs in an environment different from that of original learning (Bilodeau & Schlosberg, 1951; Greenspoon & Banyard, 1957; Strand, 1970)."

This disruption, she stated, enabled subjects to more easily distinguish between the two sets of words, thus causing less interference. To test this hypothesis, she added another condition to the Bilodeau and Schlosberg (1951) experiment, having subjects momentarily leave and return to the same room before the interpolated learning session. Strand found that disruption and environmental context change reduced RI to the same extent when contrasted with the same- context undisrupted condition."

The predominate finding has been that recall increases directly with the spacing of the presentations of repeated words (the lag effect). The types of theoretical explanations that have held up best under these investigations are derived from considerations of encoding variability (Bower, 1972; Estes, 1955; Glenberg, 1976) and differential organization (Glenberg, 1977; Melton, 1970). These theories assume that the encoding of an item (and consequently, the way that item can be retrieved) is a function of the context in which the item is repeated. In addition, the context is subject to \"random contextual drift\" (Bower, 1972); that is, it changes as a function of time. Items repeated after a short lag, in the same context, derive little benefit from the second presentation since no new retrieval information is encoded. Items repeated after longer lags are likely to be repeated in different contexts so that different retrieval information is developed at the two presentations. Therefore, the items repeated after the longer lags are more accessible and are recalled more often than the items repeated after the shorter lags."

Repeated items were placed within semantic contexts intended to induce either two different sets of encodings or the same encoding twice. For example, if the presentations of the word \"foot\" were preceded first by the list words \"inch\" and \"meter\" and then later by \"arm\" and \"hand,\" two different contexts (and encodings) would be induced. Preceding the second presentation of \"foot\" by \"mile\" and \"yard\" would induce the same context and the same encoding. Using this paradigm, Gartman and Johnson (1972) found that words repeated within two different contexts were recalled much more often than words repeated within similar contexts, regardless of the interpresentation lag."

A list was repeated after a 3- h interval either in the same or in a different environmental context, and subjects were then tested for free recall in a neutral context after an additional 3- h interval. The neutral context was not obviously similar to either of the input contexts, and hence, should not have favored retrieval from one context of the other. If the two contexts induce two sets of retrieval information, then subjects in the different input- context condition would be expected to recall more than subjects in the same input- context condition."

Words were presented on slides in a semidarkened room where only a small red light and the slide projector provided illumination. Context M (Mason Hall) involved a very tiny compartment within the animal laboratories in a large, modern, central campus building. Two windows overlooked a large courtyard, and a one- way mirror covered another wall. Instructions and word lists were presented by a female voice on a tape recorder. The neutral context was a large classroom with large windows overlooking a busy street, and there was little clutter around the room. Although the same experimenter was present in all contexts, the appearance of the experimenter was varied systematically and substantially.

Given that the subject could access both of these distinct sets at the test, the probability of retrieving an item from two possible sets should be greater than the probability of retrieving that item from one search set."

It is possible, however, that this basic result is not a result of matching or mismatching input and output environments, but rather reflects a recall decrement caused by being in a new environment. Subjects in Experiment 2 learned paired associate lists in different environmental contexts on 2 consecutive days and were tested on the third day for cued recall in their Day 1 context, Day 2 context, or in a third (neutral) context. The two lists used completely different response terms. Some of the stimuli, however, were common to both lists, being paired with different responses in the different contexts. If context matching, rather than context change, is responsible for the environmental context effect, then subjects tested in their Day 1 environment should recall more responses learned on Day 1 than subjects tested in their Day 2 or neutral environments, and subjects tested in their Day 2 environments should recall more Day 2 responses than subjects tested in the Day 1 or neutral contexts."

On Day 2 he was presented the other list in the other context and was tested on 15 unique pairs from that list. On Day 3 subjects were tested in their Day 1 context (Group 1), in their Day 2 context (Group 2), or in the neutral context (Group N). The final cued recall test consisted of the 15 common- cue items, followed by the 30 untested unique pairs from the two lists. Since the greatest concern was response to the common cues, they were tested first in order to avoid recreating either list context. For example, if a number of unique List 1 items preceded the testing of a common cue, then the List 1 response to the common cue might be dominant, and list context would be confounded with environmental context."

The search- set hypothesis predicts that category recall will be adversely affected by a change in the context between input and test, but that recall of words within a category will not be so affected. If, however, contextual information is an integral part of each encoding or is associated with it (the single- link hypothesis), then recall of both categories and words within categories will be affected by the context change."

Instructions were to sort the shuffled pile of category exemplars into 10 piles, placing each pile next to its proper superordinate on the list of category names. Subjects then wrote the exemplars in their distinct categories, designating for each word whether it seemed to be a \"good or common\" exemplar of the category or a \"poor or uncommon\" exemplar. This procedure was adopted so that subjects would devote a good deal of processing to the words, but would not rehearse words between sessions."

What it does imply is that some memory process other than search- set retrieval is affected by changes of environmental context. This result is consistent, for example, with the idea that the environment, or its representation in memory, is more directly linked with encoded verbal material than is implied by the search- set hypothesis. It is possible that the environment, or a part of it, is directly associated with individual list words, or that the environment helps a subject to determine whether a potential retrieval route is a correct one. Another possibility is that encodings of list words contain environmental information, as suggested by Anderson and Bower (1974). In this case, recognition of implicitly retrieved words would be improved by contextual reinstatement; the composite test stimulus (i.e., the implicitly retrieved word plus environment) would have more overlap with the encoded memory trace and would be more likely to be recognized as a correct response."

Subjects in Experiment 4 were presented with a list of words to learn and were tested on a few of the words with a brief recognition test. The next day subjects were taken either to the same or to a different context and were given either a free recall test or a recognition test. A recall task may be analyzed as consisting of at least two general classes of processes: retrieval, or accessing previously encoded traces, and a decision whether the recovered trace represents an item actually presented in the experiment (e.g., Kintsch, 1970). Either or both of these types of processes could be influenced by environmental context. Experiments 4 and 5 investigated this possibility."

A recognition test, however, may require more than just a decision process; for example, the subject might first have to access an encoded semantic sense from the test word, and then apply the decision process to the semantically disambiguated trace (Anderson & Bower, 1974). The set of stimuli used in Experiment 4 allowed us to look separately at context effects in the encoding and decision stages. If environmental context influences the semantic encoding of a word, then it would be expected to have more of an effect upon recognition of balanced homographs and high- frequency words than upon polarized homographs and low- frequency words. The former two groups of words have larger repertoires of semantic senses (Reder, Anderson, & Bjork, 1974) and, hence, are more likely to be encoded differently in different contexts. If environmental context only affects the decision, then all types of words used should be affected."

The purpose of this partial test was twofold: to get an initial measure of the subject's performance, and to give the first session a sense of closure so that subjects would not actively rehearse list words between sessions. On this recognition test, subjects gave confidence ratings on a 1- 6 scale as to whether they judged a test word to be new or old. A response of \"1\" indicated that the subject was absolutely certain that a test word was old, \"2\" meant he was fairly certain the word was old, and \"3\" meant he was only slightly certain that the word was old. Responses of \"4,\" \"5,\" and \"6\" indicated increasing certainty that a word was new."

Experiment 2 illustrated that the environmental context can influence processes at the time of a memory test, and that matching the input and test context results in better performance than mismatching the context (cf. Thomson & Tulving, 1970). Experiment 3 found same- context better than different- context performance on recall of categories and recall of words within a category. This result parallels a finding by Eich et al. (1975), who manipulated the \"inner experiential context\" associated with drug states, although they found only a small and nonsignificant effect of context on the number of words per category recalled."

The retrieval- decision hypothesis seems inadequate to account for the results of Experiment 5, which indicate that the decision subprocess in recall is not influenced by environmental context. Although the search- set hypothesis accurately predicted environmental context to affect recall of categories in Experiment 3, it did not predict the context effect upon recall of words within a category. The latter result suggests a more direct linkage between words and the environmental context of their presentation (the single- link hypothesis) than is implied by the search- set hypothesis. The single- link hypothesis also does not fare too well, however; it does not seem consistent with the lack of context effects in tests of recognition. A close linking of context and list words would be expected to affect recognition memory (e.g., Anderson & Bower, 1974)."

In free recall, where the experimenter provides few explicit retrieval cues, the subject must make use of varied sources of cues to provide access to the stimuli. Environmental context could be one such source of cues. In cued recall there is more specific retrieval information, and in recognition memory the subject is supplied with highly effective, explicit cues, thereby reducing his dependence on other cue sources. Although the experiments in the present investigation are not directly comparable with each other, it seems that the continuity hypothesis is consistent with the robust effects of environmental context found for free recall (Experiments 1, 3, and 4), the moderate effects on cued recall (Experiment 2), and the lack of effect of environment on recognition memory (Experiments 4 and 5)."

Environmental contexts used in the present investigation were designed merely to be very different from each other, and relations between list words and environments were not considered. It may be possible, however, to arrange such relations; for example, the words \"knot\" and \"bow\" might be memorized differently if learned on an ocean liner rather than in a gift- wrapping shop."

What aspects of the environment (e.g., time of day, color of walls, appearance of the experimenter) are important? The environmental context effect has been demonstrated for list- learning studies of episodic memory and for one classroom situation (Abernethy, 1940); will environmental context be as important for remembering connected discourse, mathematical or logical relations, and motor skills? Is the context effect dependent on how well information is learned? The range of empirical questions is too wide to cover here, but it is obvious that the relevance of the matter of context extends to more areas than have been examined in the present investigation."
