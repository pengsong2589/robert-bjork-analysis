Learners, however, tend to believe the opposite, even after their own performance has benefited from interleaving. In Experiments 1 and 2, the authors examined the influence of 2 factors that they hypothesized contribute to the illusion that blocking enhances inductive learning: Namely, that (a) blocking creates a sense of fluent extraction during study of the features defining a given category, and (b) learners come to the experimental task with a pre- existing belief that blocking instruction by topic is superior to intermixing topics. In Experiments 3–5, the authors attempted to uproot learners' belief in the superiority of blocking through experience- based and theory- based debiasing techniques by (a) providing detailed theory- based information as to why blocking seems better, but is not, and (b) explicitly drawing attention to the link between study schedule and subsequent performance, both of which had only modest effects. Only when they disambiguated test performance on the 2 schedules by separating them (Experiment 6) did the combination of experience- and theory- based debiasing lead a majority of learners to appreciate interleaving. Overall, the results indicate that 3 influences combine to make altering learners' misconceptions difficult: the sense of fluency that can accompany nonoptimal modes of instruction; pre- existing beliefs learners bring to new tasks; and the willingness, even eagerness, to believe that 1 is unique as a learner—that what enhances others' learning differs from what enhances one's own learning."

Learners, for example, fail to appreciate (a) the pedagogical benefits of testing (e.g., Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012; Karpicke, Butler, & Roediger, 2009; Kornell & Bjork, 2007); (b) that producing errors can sometimes enhance learning (e.g., Huelser & Metcalfe, 2012); and (c) that spacing, rather than massing, repeated practice or study sessions tends to enhance long- term retention (e.g., Cohen, Yan, Halamish, & Bjork, 2013; Simon & Bjork, 2001; Zechmeister & Shaughnessy, 1980)."

In these studies (and this paradigm is replicated in the present experiments), participants study six paintings by each of 12 artists, with these paintings presented one at a time. For half of the artists, their paintings are presented blocked by artist (all six paintings by the same artist are presented consecutively); for the other artists, their paintings are presented interleaved (paintings by the six different artists are intermixed). On the final test, participants are shown new paintings and asked to select from a list of names the artist responsible for each. Interleaving benefits are robust and the effect size is large (e.g., "

That is, teachers tend to create course syllabi that are blocked by topic, trainers frequently structure practice sessions so that learners work on one skill at a time, and textbook authors tend to cover topics in a blocked fashion. In mathematics courses, for example, children often learn one formula and then practice multiple problems of that type before moving on to learning the next formula. This blocked method typically leads to excellent performance during practice, but—as shown by Rohrer and Taylor (2007)—interleaving (practicing four different problem types intermixed) leads to far better long- term learning. Another factor is that learners may intuit that inducing concepts from exemplars relies on being able to see the commonalities across exemplars that define a category, leading them to develop a belief that blocking will make those commonalities more apparent. In other words, there may also be theory- based reasons for learners' metacognitive illusions."

When learning motor and procedural skills, for example, blocking tends to produce better performance during acquisition (see, e.g., Shea & Morgan, 1979; Simon & Bjork, 2001). Subjective experiences during an induction task may also be influential: Viewing blocked exemplars of a given category can lead to a sense of fluency, reinforcing the feeling that blocking enhances inductive learning. Prior studies (e.g., Begg, Duft, Lalonde, Melnick, & Sanvito, 1989; Hertzog, Dunlosky, Robinson, & Kidder, 2003; Koriat & Ma'ayan, 2005) have shown that a higher subjective ease of processing can lead to higher judgments of learning (JOLs; i.e., use of the heuristic: \"easily learned means easily remembered\"; Koriat, 2008), and it may simply feel easier to study exemplars in a blocked schedule. Such experiences, therefore, may be another source of the metacognitive illusion that blocking is more effective than interleaving."

In contrast, the memory literature typically elicits JOLs from participants, in which participants are asked to judge the likelihood that they would be able to recall specific items on a future test. These CLJs were elicited for only half of the artists and only twice for each of those artists—once early during acquisition and late in acquisition—rather than for every single item (as is often common in JOL studies). Doing so not only avoided overly disrupting the participants' learning, but also allowed us to compare changes in the subjective experience of learning. In Experiment 1B (separate, so as to avoid contamination by the item- by- item judgments), we asked participants to provide CLJs after study, and we also asked participants to recall how each category had been studied after they made the CLJs, thereby more directly examining how participants might connect their CLJs with the study schedule. Next, in Experiment 2, we informed learners of how well they classified new paintings by the blocked and interleaved artists, thereby revealing to them which study schedule had led to their better learning. We then compared the reasons participants gave for why they performed better in that condition to answer the following question: When faced with an interleaving advantage in their own performance, will participants attribute that benefit to interleaving being a more effective study schedule, or will they attribute their better performance to some other factor?"

As mentioned earlier, many other effective study strategies also go underappreciated, but how much intervention is needed to improve learners' metacognitive accuracy appears to vary by strategy. For example, deWinstanley and Bjork (2004) found that just the experience of a benefit of generating over reading on a first test passage was enough for participants to learn about the benefit of generation and transfer that to their learning of a second test passage. Tullis, Finley, and Benjamin (2013) asked participants to learn cue- target word pairs and found that more guidance (than simply experiencing their own test performance) was required for participants to learn about the benefits of testing over restudying: Item- by- item JOLs were only improved if they were elicited at a delay and in the presence of the cue- only, and aggregate JOLs only improved when full feedback—indicating how many of the tested items and how many of the restudied items were answered correctly on the final test—was provided."

For example, when people are told to expect a cued- recall test, where they will be provided a cue and asked to recall the target word associated to that cue, they give very similar JOLS to the pairs lamp- light and light- lamp, even though the latter is far more difficult of an item than the former (consider how many other strong associates there are for the word light, and which will come to mind during a test where light- ?? is presented). They found that only a combination of both experience- based (i.e., experiencing the memorial differences between the conditions) and theory- based (i.e., an explanation as to why this occurs) debiasing methods improved metacognitive accuracy for a new set of word pairs."

In Experiments 4- 6, we combined experience- based and theory- based debiasing. Our experience- based debiasing manipulations consisted of attempts to draw participants' attention to their actual test performance vis- a- vis presentation schedules by (a) asking participants during the test how a given artist's paintings had been scheduled during study (Experiment 4), by (b) presenting paintings by blocked and interleaved artists set against different frames (Experiment 5), and by (c) separating blocked and interleaved learning phases (Experiment 6)."

During study, a total of 72 landscape paintings (six by each of 12 artists; a list of their names can be found in Kornell & Bjork, 2008) were presented with the artist's name shown below each painting, one at a time, and at a 3- s rate. The six paintings by a given artist were either blocked or interleaved with those of other artists, with assignment of an artist to study schedule condition randomized across participants (except as noted in Experiments 2 and 6). The order of presentation followed the scheme: B I I B B I I B B I I B, where every B refers to a set of six paintings by the same artist and every I refers to a set of six paintings by six different artists (the order of these six artists was always randomized). To ensure that there was no effect of the order of the B and I sets, we counterbalanced the order (i.e., half of the participants started with the I set) in Experiments 1B and 2. The specific ordering did not interact with any effect, and therefore, is not discussed further, nor was it counterbalanced in any of the subsequent experiments."

In Experiments 3- 5, where attempts of theory- based debiasing occurred, the relevant information was inserted at this point. Finally, the main metacognitive question present in every study (except Experiment 2) was asked after the test: \"Which learning schedule led to the most effective learning?\" Participants selected their response from one of three options: blocked (studying all six examples by one artist in a row), interleaved (all six of a given artist's paintings were spread out throughout the study phase), or the two schedules were equally effective."

In making item- by- item JOLs, participants are often captured by item information and current fluency, which can be a poor indicator for the likelihood of future recall. Delayed JOLs, however, are made after a delay, at which point participants may have a better sense for how quickly "

For Experiment 1A, the procedure was similar to that described in the General Method section above with the following exceptions: For the study phase, participants were additionally informed prior to beginning study that they would occasionally be asked to judge how likely they would be able to recognize a new painting by the just- studied artist on the final test using a rating scale of 0 (not at all) to 100 (definitely). These CLJs were solicited for a randomly selected half of the blocked and half of the interleaved artists and were made after the third and sixth paintings of each of those artists had been studied. The three blocked artists for whom CLJs were solicited were studied as either the first, third, and fifth blocked artists or the second, fourth, and sixth blocked artists. In total, CLJs were solicited 12 times throughout the study phase. In the test phase, participants were tested on one new painting per artist, with trial- by- trial feedback. Finally, they were asked to make the metacognitive judgment about which schedule was more effective for learning."

Participants identified the correct schedule only about two thirds of the time, and, furthermore, were more likely to state that an artist had been studied interleaved when they incorrectly, not correctly, identified the artist responsible for a given test painting (similar to what was found in Experiment 1B). We reasoned, therefore, that our manipulations might have elicited participants' a priori theories about the superiority of blocking instead of linking test performance to prior study schedules. Another possible factor is that our use of four tests- with- feedback blocks, which allowed successful classification rates for blocked and interleaved artists to became similar by the final test block, made it less clear to participants which schedule had actually led to better test performance."

Three paintings by Vincent van Gogh were shown for 3 s each, with the appropriate frame and artist name written beneath each image (the \"blocking\" demonstration), and then four paintings by four different artists (Claude Monet, Leonardo da Vinci, Salvador Dali, and Vincent van Gogh) were shown, again with the appropriate frame and appropriate name printed beneath each image (the \"interleaving\" demonstration).

First, instead of intermixing blocked and interleaved study in one single study list, participants studied the blocked and interleaved artists in two separate study- test cycles. Six of the artists were assigned to the first cycle, and the remaining six artists were assigned to the second cycle. The \"sets\" of six artists were the same as those used in Experiment 2. Assignment of artist \"set\" to cycle (first or second) was counterbalanced. One of the study- test cycles presented the artists' paintings in a blocked schedule, and the other cycle presented the artists' paintings in an interleaved schedule. The order in which participants experienced the schedules (blocked- then- interleaved, or interleaved- then- blocked) was also counterbalanced."

On the other hand, those who had experienced an interleaving benefit were more likely to attribute their performance to the interleaved set of to- be- learned artists simply being easier than the blocked set of to- be- learned artists, even though we had taken measures to ensure that the two sets of artists were of equal difficulty. Furthermore, the participants who had experienced an interleaving benefit were much less likely than those who had experienced a blocking benefit to attribute their interleaved success to the efficacy of the study schedule, despite the fact that the average interleaving benefit (24%) was substantially larger than the average blocking benefit (13%)."

The present results suggest several, not necessarily mutually exclusive, sources of this belief. First, as we conjectured earlier, participants may carry with them the belief that blocking is good because their teachers, coaches, and textbook authors have tended to block, not interleave, instruction—a belief that is then difficult to dislodge in a single experimental session. In addition, the apparent, if misleading, ease of learning felt when studying exemplars in a blocked manner—and the lack thereof when studying exemplars in an interleaved manner—is probably very difficult to discount and serves to support individuals' prior belief in the benefits of blocking. Finally—perhaps as a note of interest, rather than as something we directly tested—the participants in our studies demonstrated a surprising eagerness to place themselves in the minority "

This \"stickiness\" of learners to blocking is simply one example of the many metacognitive illusions that learners hold, and although the focus so far has largely been on individual learners managing their own learning, it is also critical that instructors those in charge of managing the learners of others- also understand how we learn. The present research therefore adds to the growing body of literature illustrating that learners and instructors alike are prone to certain misconceptions about how to learn and strikingly demonstrates that overcoming such misconceptions- however crucial to achieving our potential as learners and as instructors- is remarkably difficult."
