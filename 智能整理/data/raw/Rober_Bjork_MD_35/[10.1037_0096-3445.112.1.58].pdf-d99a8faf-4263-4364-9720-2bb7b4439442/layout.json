Some kind of \"missing mechanism\" appears to be involved. In order to circumvent the methodological constraints that have limited the conclusions investigators could draw from past experiments, a new paradigm is introduced herein that includes a mixture of intentional and incidental learning. With this paradigm, a midlist instruction to forget the first half of a list was found to reduce later recall of the items learned incidentally as well as those learned intentionally. This result suggests that a cue to forget can lead to a disruption of retrieval processes as well as to the alteration of encoding processes postulated in prior theories. The results also provide a link between intentional forgetting and the literature on posthypnotic amnesia, in which disrupted retrieval has been implicated. With each of these procedures, the information that can be remembered is typically recalled out of order and often with limited recollection for when the information had been presented. It therefore was concluded here that retrieval inhibition plays a significant role in nonhypnotic as well as in hypnotic instances of directed forgetting. The usefulness of retrieval inhibition as a mechanism for memory updating was also discussed."

The volume of literature that has been generated under the rubric of directed forgetting has been enormous with an incredible number of variations in procedure (see Bjork, 1972; Epstein, 1972; and Timmins, 1976, for reviews). In many of the more recent experiments, these paradigms have been used as investigative tools to address issues of memory other than the nature of intentional forgetting itself. Among the topics that have been addressed are effects of rehearsal on recall and recognition (Woodward, Bjork, & Jongeward, 1973) and constituent processes in the differentiation of items in memory (Bjork & Geiselman, 1978)."

The first is the effect of the forget instruction on the recall of the R items. Hence, the typical study compares the level of recall of R items presented after a cue to forget the prior items in a list with the level of recall of R items in two control conditions- one in which only the R items are presented, and one in which subjects are not given the cue to forget the initial items. Such comparisons typically demonstrate the striking power of the forget instruction to eliminate the interference from the to- be- forgotten (F) items- sometimes completely (Bjork, 1970). Studies of directed forgetting, then, substantiate the suggestions of Ribot (1882), James (1890), and Bjork (1972) that selective forgetting plays an integral role in the successful processing of R information."

This question is the primary focus of the present research. Even though the recall of F items is typically very low when tested, the recognition of F items is typically quite high (Davis & Okada, 1971), sometimes equal to that for R items (Block, 1971; Geiselman, 1974, 1977). Because of these results, the hypothesis that a cue to forget serves to erase an F item from memory has been dismissed. Similarly, it does not appear that a cue to forget inhibits the consolidation of an F item in memory (Bjork & Geiselman, 1978)."

That is, the difference in a subject's ability to recall the R versus F items has usually been explained in terms of a difference in the amount or type of rehearsal given to the items. There are a variety of results that are consistent with such an explanation. Often, for example, the increase in recall of R items that accompanies a cue to forget is approximately equal in magnitude to the corresponding decrease in recall of the F items (Geiselman, 1974; Reitman, Malin, Bjork, & Higman, 1973). Also, if the forget instruction is given at the time of recall rather than immediately following the F items, the forget instruction has little if any effect on recall performance (Bjork, 1970). Finally, one manipulation that appears to reduce the deleterious effect of cue to forget on F- item recall is to increase the amount of elaborative rehearsal given to the item before it is cued to be forgotten. For example, Bugelski (1970) has shown that requiring complex processing of F words, such as imaging, eliminates the effect of forget cues on the recall of the F words. Also, Roediger and Crowder (1972) have shown that when subjects are told to forget an item within the Brown- Peterson paradigm, the subjects perform more optimally on the distractor task."

The addition of the differential- grouping mechanism is necessary to account for two classes of results. One is that when paired associates are used as the stimulus materials, subjects rarely give R responses to F- item probes or vice versa, even though they do make intrasublist intrusion errors (Bjork, 1970). The other is that if a series of logically connected sentences is used as the stimulus materials, the decrease in F- item recall and the increase in R- item recall are less than if sentences are used that do not have a logical ordering (Geiselman, 1974). This result implies that differential grouping of the items is necessary in order to conduct selective rehearsal efficiently."

Each set of four words was presented one word at a time (2.3 sec per word). After the last word in a set, there was a 3- sec rehearsal period, which was in turn followed by a 1- sec cue that informed the subjects as to which of the four words, if any, they would have to remember at the end of the experiment. Immediately after the cue, the next word set was presented. Subjects were instructed to devote all of their rehearsal activities to the current set of words, something they said they were only too happy to do because of the demanding nature of the task."

The magnitude of task- evoked pupillary dilations is commonly taken as an index of cognitive load. Johnson (1971) reported a short- lived increase (followed by a sizeable decrease) in pupil dilation in subjects immediately following a cue to forget all prior items in a list. Although it has been argued that the momentary decrease in residual processing capacity is due to the processing of the cue itself, this seems unlikely. It should not take more processing capacity to process a cue that is well learned in the experiment and expected occasionally than to process another list item. Further, it is probably not the case that the pupillary response immediately following an F cue is due solely to the preparation of a new rehearsal scheme for the R items because such a process is also necessary at the very beginning of the list where no such response was observed. A startle- response explanation is inappropriate as well because a control group who received the cues without meaning did not show a corresponding pupil dilation. It is curious then what must have occurred, either consciously or unconsciously, immediately following the cue to forget."

His experiment was modeled on what may be referred to as the \"harried short- order cook\" phenomenon. Once an order has been filled, the cook must actively forget that order so that it will not interfere with his memory for unfilled orders. In Timmin's experiment, subjects were presented a list of words, some of which were repeated in the list. Only nonrepeated words were to be remembered. The initial presentation and encoding of a word was viewed to be analogous to the taking of an order, and its repetition to be analogous to the filling of that order, at which time it could (and should) be forgotten. Nonrepeated words represented orders that were unfilled and therefore were to be remembered. The subjects were told that when a word was repeated, they should \"stop trying to remember it and forget it if you can.\" They were further told that it was to their advantage to actively forget the repeated items during the presentation of the list so that these items would not interfere with their memory for the nonrepeated items."

In a condition where no mention was made of forgetting the repeated items, the repeated items were remembered more often than the nonrepeated items (43% vs. 27%). However, with the active- forgetting instructions, the repeated (F) items were recalled slightly less often than were the nonrepeated items (21% vs. 27%), even though the subjects were told at test to try to recall all the items. This result, which is reminiscent of the Zeigarnik effect where uncompleted tasks are more likely to be remembered than completed tasks (filled orders), provides some support for the notion that subjects can actively block access routes to previously encoded information. However, as was noted above, we cannot be sure to what extent the subjects were engaging in active response withholding (suppression) at test, even though they were told to try to recall everything."

This result is typical in studies of posthypnotic amnesia (Evans & Kihlstrom, 1973; Freud, 1920/1952, p. 288; Kihlstrom & Evans, 1976) in which hypnotized subjects are given a suggestion to forget certain events with an accompanying countercommand that will later signal the removal of this suggestion. Such a countercommand could not negate an initial encoding deficit resulting from the F cue; but the countercommand does, in large part, reverse the previous recall impairment. An analogous experiment on nonhypnotic forgetting was conducted by Reed (1970). In his experiment, some letter trigrams were initially cued R, whereas others were initially cued F. On a later repetition of the trigrams, the F commands were reversed. Consistent with the inhibition release idea and at first glance inconsistent with the encoding deficit notion, subjects were able to recall just as many trigrams that were initially F cued as were initially R cued. Unfortunately, independent research on the repetition effect suggests that the magnitude of the effect may be greater if the initial presentation is more difficult to remember at the time of the second presentation (cf. the argument in Bjork, 1972, p. 228). Thus, Reed's results are not"

The present paradigm involves a typical directed- forgetting procedure in which an unpredictable F cue is presented in the middle of certain lists. The innovation is that some material throughout the list (both precue and postcue) is learned incidentally, via a pleasantness- judging task, and is therefore not explicitly subject to the F cue. Thus, any effect of the F cue on the retention of the incidental items, for which selective rehearsal or response withholding would be unlikely, can be compared with the effect of the F cue on the to- be- learned items. If the F cue were to have no effect on the recall of the items that the subjects had no intent to rehearse for later recall (the to- be- judged words), then selective rehearsal would provide an adequate accounting of the results. If, on the other hand, the F cue were to affect the recall of the items learned incidentally as well as those learned intentionally, then disrupted retrieval for events occurring prior to the cue would provide a more plausible explanation of the results. Response withholding should not be a factor because the subjects are not told to forget the items learned incidentally, and hence there is no conflict created."

The first list- half learn words would therefore receive less rehearsal than in the R- cue condition, and the second list- half learn words would receive more rehearsal. The judge words, on the other hand, are not rehearsed in any condition so such selective rehearsal arguments cannot apply to those items. In fact, the enhanced recall of postcue judge words in the F- cue condition is as surprising as the poorer recall of the precue judge words. Two sources of evidence imply that the subjects did not rehearse the judge words along with the learn words. First, on a postexperimental questionnaire, none of the 32 subjects reported that they suspected a \"surprise\" test on the judge words.

This outcome is intriguing because Hyde and Jenkins (1969, 1973) and others have shown that intent to remember has no greater effect on recall than certain semantic orienting tasks, such as the pleasantness judgment task in the present experiment. However, intent to learn has been found to yield greater delayed recall when intent is manifested in differential interitem organization (Battig & Bellezza, 1979). Given that the judge words were not rehearsed, it appears that they do not profit from the kind of interitem associations that are formed via cumulative rehearsal in the learn word case. Alternatively, perhaps the interassociation network for the learn words served to inhibit the retrieval of the judge words (Anderson & Bower, 1973)."

As can be seen by comparing Figure 2 with Tables.1 and 2, the words presented in the second list half following the R cue also were recalled at a low level, comparable to that of the pre- F- cue words, but the classification performance was much more accurate for the post- R- cue words (.95 vs. .63 for the learn words and .69 vs. .36 for the judge words), and the input- output order correlation was highly significant for the post- R- cue words (.70). These results are consistent with findings reported within the hypnosis domain.

The complete absence of significant effects of list half, item type, and cue type is quite remarkable in view of the dramatic effects of those same variables reflected in the various measures of recall performance reported above. The F cue clearly had its effects primarily on the retrieval side."

There are two plausible explanations for the pattern of recall results described above other than the retrieval- inhibition hypothesis. First, perhaps the judge words became unavoidably interassociated with the learn words to some extent. The effect of the F cue on the judge words could then be explained as a disrupted- rehearsal phenomenon without reference to retrieval processes. Two aspects of the data from Experiment 1 argue against this hypothesis; namely, the judge words were not confused with the learn words in the classification data, and there was no second list- half primacy effect for the judge words following the F cue. Nevertheless, Experiment 2 was designed to render the learn and judge words completely nonconfusable with each other; they were drawn from two distinct semantic categories, nouns representing animate entities and nouns representing inanimate entities."

As in Experiment 1, the correlation between input order and output order was found to be depressed for the learn words presented prior to the F cue. Given the somewhat higher level of recall in this experiment, these correlations could also be examined for the judge words, and the same pattern was observed as for the learn words. In sum, these data replicate and extend the classification and input- output order data from Experiment 1 and further suggest that an F cue leads to disrupted retrieval."

Presumably, subjects in the R- cue condition would show no list- half preference in starting their recall (or, possibly, would tend to start with the first list half). The design of Experiment 3 permitted measurement of the average output position for any given word in each condition."

The output- interference hypothesis predicts that with the F cue, the words from the second list half are recalled first, before the words from the first list half are recalled. To evaluate this prediction, a measure of average output position for each of four classifications of words was computed for each subject. The four classifications were first- half learn words, second- half learn words, first- half judge words, and second- half judge words. Because the nominal output position is confounded between subjects with differences in the number of words recalled, the specific measure of output position was an output- position percentile, as developed by Bjork and Whitten (1974). The output- position percentile for a given word that is recalled was computed as nominal output position divided by total number of words recalled by that subject then multiplied by 100."

It is not clear, however, why the same outcome did not obtain for the remaining two cases. With the F cue, the second list- half words were not misclassified more when the first list- half words were output first; with the R cue, the first list- half words were not classified correctly more often when the first list- half words were output first. Perhaps the subjects in these conditions were less likely to write down words they were unsure about on the first page because a greater number of words were accessible to them for recall in those cases. That is, there may have been a reduced tendency to \"pad\" the recall on the first page. Because of these potential confounding biases, input- output order correlations were not computed for Experiment 4."

This effect was observed for items that the subjects had no a priori intent to remember (items learned incidentally) as well as for R words. It does not seem possible to explain the present results without postulating that a cue to forget has the power to initiate a process that blocks or inhibits access routes to the F items. If the F cue served only to terminate rehearsal of the pre- F- cue learn words, then the forget instruction should have had no effect on the recall of the words learned incidentally, which were not rehearsed in any case. Because recognition performance was unimpaired, it appears that the inhibition induced via the F cue took the form of retrieval blocking. Two less dramatic, less interesting interpretations of the depressed recall of the pre- F- cue incidental items were ruled out, one by Experiments 1 and 2 and the other by Experiments 3 and 4."

First, the subjects could not remember whether the words that were presented prior to the F cue were presented in the first half of the list or in the second half of the list. That is, they exhibited list- half source amnesia for words presented prior to the F cue. Second, the average correlation between input order and output order for words presented prior to the F cue was greatly depressed. These results are comparable to those reported from studies of posthypnotic amnesia (Evans & Kihlstrom, 1973; Kihlstrom & Evans, 1976), in which disrupted retrieval also has been implicated. Thus, intentional forgetting and posthypnotic amnesia appear to have strong parallels such that future work in one discipline should impact on the other. For example, it has been shown that subjects who experience posthypnotic amnesia do not have differentially poor waking memories (Kihlstrom & Twersky, 1978), but future research may reveal that these individuals are more likely to forget when the forgetting is intentional, as in the present experiments. That is, there may be a subset of individuals who are extremely efficient at forgetting. Consistent with this argument is the recent finding by Geiselman et al. (in press) that subjects who exhibit low F- item recall in a nonhypnotic directed- forgetting experiment are the subjects who are most likely to exhibit low recall (prior to the countercommand) in a hypnotic amnesia experiment."

Further, once a hypnotic suggestion to forget is lifted, previously hypnotized subjects can retrieve much of the target information from memory. No convincing procedure for reversing a nonhypnotic forget command has been reported. Thus, it is apparent that procedures that rely on hypnosis obtain greater control over the subjects' recall performance, whereas the nonhypnotic pro"

Any ongoing information- processing system needs some mechanism for updating information, that is, some means by which to prevent old, out- of- date information from interfering with new, current information. In a sense, computers are the ultimate in efficiency in updating because storing new information at a given memory location obliterates the prior entry. However, should it become important to gain access to the out- of- date information, such an updating system is not optimal. In comparison, inhibition that takes the form of retrieval blocking has some desirable properties as an updating mechanism. On the one hand, information that is not retrievable is also noninterfering. On the other hand, such \"blocked\" information is still readily recognizable as having occurred before, and it appears that upon becoming pertinent again (that is, changing from F. to R), such information shows a repetition effect (Reed, 1970)."
