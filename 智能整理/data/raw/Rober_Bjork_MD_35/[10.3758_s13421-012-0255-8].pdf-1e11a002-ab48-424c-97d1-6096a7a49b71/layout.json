                                    "content": "Abstract There are many instances in which perceptual disfluency leads to improved memory performance, a phenomenon often referred to as the perceptual- interference effect (e.g., Diemand- Yauman, Oppenheimer, & Vaughn (Cognition 118:111- 115, 2010); Nairne (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition 14:248- 255, 1988)). In some situations, however, perceptual disfluency does not affect memory (Rhodes & Castel (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 137:615- 625, 2008)), or even impairs memory (Glass, (Psychology and Aging 22:233- 238, 2007)). Because of the uncertain effects of perceptual disfluency, it is important to establish when disfluency is a \"desirable difficulty\" (Bjork, 1994) and when it is not, and the degree to which people's judgments of learning (JOLs) reflect the consequences of processing disfluent information. In five experiments, our participants saw multiple lists of blurred and clear words and gave JOLs after each word. The JOLs were consistently higher for the perceptually fluent items in within- subjects designs, which accurately predicted the pattern of recall performance when the presentation time was short (Exps. 1a and 2a). When the final test was recognition or when the presentation time was long, however, we found no difference in recall for clear and blurred words, although JOLs continued to be higher for clear words (Exps. 2b and 3). When fluency was manipulated between subjects, neither JOLs nor recall varied between formats (Exp. 1b). This study suggests a boundary condition for the desirable difficulty of perceptual disfluency and indicates that a visual distortion, such as blurring a word, may not always induce the deeper processing necessary to create a perceptual- interference effect."

For example, items that are perceived as more perceptually fluent (e.g., larger in font size or greater in visual clarity) are more likely to be judged as typical members of a category (Oppenheimer & Frank, 2008) or as having been previously studied (Whittlesea, Jacoby, & Girard, 1990). The effect of perceptual fluency extends to memory predictions: More easily processed words are usually predicted to be more recallable or recognizable in the future (Begg, Duft, Lalonde, Melnick, & Sanvito, 1989; Hirshman & Mulligan, 1991; Nairne, 1988; Rhodes & Castel, 2008)."

Hirshman and Mulligan (1991) and Mulligan (1996) examined the effects of perceptual interference on memory using pattern masks to occlude words almost immediately after their initial presentation. These researchers found that words in the perceptual- interference condition were recognized and recalled better than words that were not visually obscured. Such improved performance on explicit memory tests as a result of interfering with perceptual processing has been termed the perceptual- interference effect (Mulligan, 1996)."

(2011), it appears that disfluency acted as a \"desirable difficulty\" (Bjork, 1994)—that is, a learning condition that makes encoding more difficult, but also engages processes that support learning and improve long- term retention. One explanation for why disfluency can be a desirable difficulty is that interfering with the perceptual processing of an item leads to additional, higher- level processing, which strengthens the associations among visual, semantic, and acoustic information in the perceptual system. The strengthening of these associations leads to better memory for the items in the interference condition than in the intact condition (Hirshman & Mulligan, 1991; Mulligan, 1996). Similarly, Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, and Eyre (2007) speculated that a low degree of fluency during a learning event may act as a cue to engage in deeper, more elaborative processing. Thus, perceptual disfluency, such as a difficult- to- read typeface or the need to mentally invert a word in order to read it, induces the type of effortful processing that improves memory for those \"difficult\" items."

(2011) might tempt educators to apply similar manipulations in their classrooms in order to aid their students' learning—for example, creating lecture slides in an unusual font or even leaving the projector slightly out of focus. Perceptual disfluency does not, however, consistently lead to improved memory. Rhodes and Castel (2008), for example, found that while words presented in larger font were given higher JOLs than words presented in smaller font, recall was unaffected. In addition, Lindenberger, Scherer, and Baltes (2001) created perceptual disfluency by giving middle- aged adults sensory filters to simulate impaired visual and auditory acuity, but found that such disfluency neither enhanced nor impaired later recall of text passages or paired associates. Some studies even indicate negative performance effects of perceptual disfluency: Stimulus degradation causes an increase in reaction times for lexical decision tasks (Plourde & Besner, 1997; Yap & Balota, 2007), and performance on memory tasks that demand a "

Yap and Balota (2007), for example, hypothesized that the visual quality of a stimulus (i.e., how degraded or clear it is) affects an early stage of encoding and causes slower reaction times for lexical decision tasks (see also Sternberg, 1969). In combination with Glass's (2007) findings, this theory predicts that some types of perceptual disfluency may impair, rather than improve, cognitive processes, particularly if the disfluency involves distorting the stimuli. Similarly, Hirshman, Trembath, and Mulligan (1994) suggested that a strong focus on the visual aspects of stimuli could prevent other types of processing from occurring, and thus impair recall."

Anything that adds to the effort required at encoding but that is irrelevant to the learning experience is extraneous load and detracts from performance on memory tasks (Sweller, van Merrienboer, & Paas, 1998). Following this logic, if the task of visually interpreting and encoding distorted stimuli exceeds working memory limits, then we may see lower recall for those items; if, however, the task is within working memory limits but does not induce extra processing of the disfluent information, we may expect to see similar performance levels between fluent and disfluent conditions, as in the findings obtained by Rhodes and Castel (2008) and Lindenberger et al.

Words were visually distorted and presented in a blurred font to create disfluency. While many different measures of disfluency (e.g., irregular or distorted font, pattern masking, or text printed by a printer low on toner) have been used in previous research (Diemand- Yauman et al., 2010; Guenther, 2012; Mulligan, 1996; Oppenheimer & Frank, 2008), we chose to use the blurring manipulation because it was conceptually similar to manipulations used in a variety of previous studies (e.g., Glass, 2007; Guenther, 2012; Lindenberger et al., 2001; Oppenheimer & Frank, 2008). In addition, out- of- focus text is not an improbable occurrence in a classroom—although instructors may not purposefully leave their projectors out of focus, or students"

The predictions for memory performance were not so clear; given the inconclusive pattern of findings on the mnemonic effects of perceptual fluency, three outcomes were possible: (1) If perceptual disfluency in the form of blurring is a desirable difficulty, we would expect better recall for blurred words as compared to clear words; (2) if this form of perceptual disfluency is more akin to the impaired visual acuity of Lindenberger et al. (2001), we would expect no difference in recall for blurred and clear words; (3) if remembering blurred words requires too high of a cognitive demand (cf. Glass, 2007), we would expect worse recall for blurred than for clear words."

Immediately following the presentation of each word, the participants verbally gave JOLs on a scale of 1- 100. We used a multilist method so that any experience- based changes in JOLs, recall, or resolution would be evident (cf. Castel, 2008; deWinstanley & Bjork, 2004). If participants did perceive any mnemonic effects of disfluency, it is likely that their JOLs on subsequent lists would change accordingly and that resolution would improve across lists. Since blurred words should be perceived as less fluent than clear words, we anticipated that JOLs would be lower for the blurred words than for the clear words. The pattern of recall performance would help determine how visual distortion affects memory, providing further insight as to the extent and/or limitations of the perceptual- disfluency effect."

Participants may have been aware that they were not remembering the blurred words very often, and adjusted their JOLs on subsequent lists accordingly; why resolution did not also improve for clear words, however, is uncertain."

Since clear words were recalled only marginally more than blurred words, it was unclear whether this level of visual distortion was only a basic manipulation of visual acuity, as in Lindenberger et al. (2001), or whether deciphering the blurred words required a high enough cognitive demand to impair recall, as in Glass (2007). Another possibility is that the within- subjects design masked any unique benefit for disfluent items. For example, Alter et al. (2007) showed that merely having a title in a disfluent font"

It should be noted, however, that there were more instances in which participants did not see a blurred word than did not see a clear word, indicating that participants did experience strong enough visual disfluency to impair perceptual identification of the word.

One possible reason for our results is that blurring may only affect lower- level visual processes—if participants are forced to attend to the low- level visual information in the distorted stimuli, they may not be able to perform the type of processing necessary to effectively encode those words. This explanation is in line with Glass's (2007) theory of sensory and cognitive effort and with classic models of memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Baddeley, 1981)."

While the effort of this act is sufficient to induce a feeling of disfluency, the learner does not have either the time or the capacity to engage in deeper processing. This interpretation may explain why both JOLs and average recall were lower for blurred words. Alternatively, recall may not be as sensitive to the perceptual- interference effect as are other explicit memory evaluations; similar studies have found stronger perceptual- interference effects on recognition tests than on free recall tests (Mulligan, 1996; Nairne, 1988). For this reason, Experiment 2b involved a recognition test instead of a recall test."

The proposed reason for this discrepancy is that during the initial perceptual identification process, the learner is focusing on surface- level aspects of the word in order to identify it. Doing so would aid later recognition, but not recall, for fluent items, given that recall relies more on item elaboration than on perceptually distinctive features (Nairne, 1988). In Experiment 2b, we tested whether blurring words would lead to similar benefits in recognition memory. An aural recognition test was administered in order to reduce any misleading effects of transfer- appropriate processing (i.e., words that were clear at"

The participants were informed that after seeing a series of words, they would hear words out loud and be asked to say \"Yes\" if they had seen those words in the presentation, and \"No\" if they had not. Instead of separating the words into lists, we presented all 52 words in one list, with one aural recognition test at the end. Similar to the previous experiments, participants were asked to rate their confidence, on a scale of 1–100, that they would be able to remember each word for a later recognition test. They were told to say \"0\" if they had not seen the word. Just as in Experiment 2a, participants were given 2 s to view the word and 2 s to make a JOL."

Consistent with Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2a, but inconsistent with prior research (e.g., Mulligan, 1996), recognition performance did not show a benefit for perceptual disfluency. In fact, blurred and clear words were equally likely to be recognized on the final test. Since recognition tests tend to be even more sensitive to the effects of disfluency (e.g., Hirshman & Mulligan, 1991), this result suggests that our inability to find a perceptual- interference effect in Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2a was likely not the result of an insensitive test."

Participants' tendency to identify a word as clear rather than blurred could indicate that when participants were confident that they had an episodic memory of seeing the word, they remembered it as clear. This interpretation may be consistent with other biases that occur when people make judgments at retrieval that are based on prior processing fluency (e.g., Benjamin et al., 1998; Castel, Rhodes, McCabe, Soderstrom, & Loaiza, 2012)."

It may be that disrupting the visual appearance of an item within a list does interfere with conceptual processing and item elaboration, effects that tend to be observed in a free recall test, but not a recognition test (Nairne, 1988). On the basis of this interpretation, in Experiment 3 we employed a free recall test in which participants were allowed even longer to process the stimuli."

This extended time might equalize processing for the blurred and clear words, effectively eliminating any benefit for clear words. If that pattern were to occur, it would suggest that visual distortions do impair encoding processes with short presentation times, but that difficulty can be overcome given more processing time. In addition, we would be able to more closely compare our results with a broader range of previous research."

We did not show a mnemonic benefit for perceptual disfluency on either form of test; in fact, we found that perceptually fluent and disfluent items were at least equally likely to be remembered (Exps. 1a, 1b, 2b, and 3), and sometimes fluent items were more likely to be remembered (Exp. 2a) than perceptually disfluent items. With the exception of Experiment 1b, JOLs were consistently greater for the clear words than for the blurred words, supporting the notion that JOLs are based on ease of processing and perceptual fluency (Begg et al., 1989). The reason that we did not observe this pattern in Experiment 1b was likely the between- subjects design; when participants were faced with words at the same level of fluency or disfluency, they had no reason to vary their JOLs, and perhaps were not even considering that the words could be presented in a better or a worse format. However, it is interesting to note that, even when there was no difference in memory performance between the two types of presentation in our within- subjects experiments (cf. Rhodes & Castel, 2008), JOLs were always greater for the clear words, suggesting that some additional, and perhaps unappreciated, processing may occur for disfluent information, consistent with other work that has shown the unappreciated benefits of desirable difficulties (e.g., Sungkhasettee et al., 2011)."

There could be several possible reasons for the impairment (Exp. 2a) or lack of effect (Exps. 1a, 1b, 2b, and 3) on memory. First, the benefits of perceptual disfluency are thought to arise as a result of deeper processing (Alter et al., 2007). It may be that blurring words, unlike inverting them or presenting them in a different font, engages processes relevant to visual perception but does not induce higher- order semantic processing (Hirshman et al., 1994). Such dynamics would also be in line with Glass's (2007) findings that for highly demanding cognitive tasks, decreased visual acuity can lead to impaired memory. In Experiment 2a, the brief length of the study time, as well as the length of the list, may have created a sufficiently demanding sensory task that it prevented participants from engaging in the deeper processing necessary to create a perceptual- interference effect. In Experiment 3, participants had sufficient time to process both types of words, and the visual degradation no longer impaired their ability to encode the stimuli, providing results more similar to those of Rhodes and Castel (2008) and Lindenberger et al. (2001)."

Initially, we anticipated that blurring the words would elicit a form of the generation effect. In this phenomenon, people are more likely to remember a word if they see only part of it and must generate the whole word on their own (Jacoby, 1978; Slamecka & Graf, 1978). For example, people tend to remember the word \"pumpkin\" better if they see \"p_mpk_n\" and must fill in the blanks than if they simply read the word in its entirety. Given multiple study- test trials, however, participants are able to improve processing of the nongenerated items enough to eliminate the advantage of generation (deWinstanley & Bjork, 2004). The proposed reason for this effect is that participants are able to monitor their learning enough to realize that more effective processing could be used to remember the read- only items."

Since that pattern did not emerge, we must seek another explanation. One possibility is that at test, even if participants recalled the word itself, they were unable to correctly recall the format in which the item had initially been presented; if that were the case, they would have no reason to attempt to change their subsequent processing of blurred items. We can see some evidence for this explanation in the incidental- format identification test in Experiment 2b. When participants correctly recognized a word, they were more likely to say that it had been clear than that it had been blurred. Perhaps the mere fact that they remembered a word modified their memory of how it had been presented, demonstrating an interesting bias in memory and explaining why we did not see improvements in recall of blurred words across lists; if participants had realized that they were recalling clear words better, they would likely have changed their JOLs to reflect that realization and/or altered how they were processing the blurred words. As it is, however, JOLs dropped uniformly for both clear and blurred words, indicating that participants did not realize that there was any difference between fluent and disfluent words in their memory. This explanation also applies to our finding that resolution was no different between blurred and clear words; participants were generally unaware of recalling the clear words more often, so they were not able to give more accurate JOLs. It is also possible that participants used only a limited range of the JOL scale, making it more difficult to see any marked improvements in JOLs or resolution."

To explain this result, we look to Koriat's (1997) cue- utilization framework. According to this framework, people use various types of cues to make predictions of future learning, but those cues do not necessarily represent factors that will affect later test performance. The visual degradation of words, therefore, may have a direct effect on JOLs in terms of people's apriori theories of how clarity affects memory, even if memory is unaffected. If participants strongly consider the clarity of a word when they make a JOL, they may activate certain theories that suggest that less perceptually clear items are less likely to be remembered, leading to the pattern evident in the present experiments: higher JOLs for clear than for blurred words, even when there was in fact no difference in memory performance for the clear and blurred words."

Hirshman et al., 1994; Rhodes & Castel, 2008)."

Instead of creating a desirable difficulty, blurring impaired learning when processing time was strictly limited and had no effect when the processing time was long enough. Interestingly, people may engage in additional processing for the blurred words that then brings the recall level to that of the cleared words, suggesting some form of additional, and beneficial, encoding of the blurred words. Finally, the present work provides insight regarding the practical implications for educational settings. While some types of disfluency may be desirable, such as presenting textual information in an unusual or distinctive font (Diemand- Yauman et al., 2010), visual distortions, such as blurred or out- of- focus text, can potentially impair learning. In other words, perceptual disfluency does not always aid recall, and thus it will be necessary to clarify when disfluency is a desirable difficulty and when it impedes learning before recommending classroom implementations."
