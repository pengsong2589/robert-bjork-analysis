We report an experiment in which the question of whether retrieval is necessary to induce this form of impairment was examined. All the subjects studied six members from each of eight taxonomic categories (e.g., fruit orange). In the competitive practice condition, the subjects practiced recalling three of the six members, using category- stem cues (e.g., fruit or __). In the noncompetitive practice condition, the subjects were reexposed to these same members for the same number of repetitions but were asked to recall the category name by using the exemplar and a stem as cues (e.g., fr __ orange). Despite significant and comparable facilitation of practiced items in both conditions, only the competitive practice subjects were impaired in their ability to recall the nonprac- ticed members on a delayed cued- recall test. These findings argue that retrieval- induced forgetting is not caused by increased competition arising from the strengthening of practiced items, but by inhibitory processes specific to the situation of recall."

Such knowledge resides outside of working memory but, nevertheless, remains in a state poised precariously at the periphery of awareness, ready, by virtue of frequent or recent use, to be handily dispensed. The present paper is concerned with these limitations on retrieval access and with the memory mechanisms that produce them. Our claim is that these limitations are not produced by the mere encoding of new knowledge but, rather, by its retrieval."

                                    "content": "Bleasdale, 1973), there is now abundant evidence establishing a more paradoxical feature of human memory: Sometimes, the act of remembering can cause forgetting. Often, recalling an event or fact impairs our later ability to recall related knowledge. In a recent study by Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork (1994), subjects performed retrieval practice on three target members from each of several previously studied six- item categories (e.g., fruits, drinks). Such retrieval practice consisted of retrieving these three exemplars three times in response to category- plus- stem cues (e.g., fruit or __ for the item orange). Following practice, subjects were less likely to recall the remaining three nonpracticed exemplars (e.g., fruit banana) on a later retention test. This deficit in the recall of related information was not short- lived, lasting at least 20 min beyond the retrieval practice session in which it was induced. Other studies using this paradigm have shown that this form of forgetting is not limited to semantic categories or even to word lists, but also occurs in the recall of visuospatial materials (Ciranni & Shimamura, 1999) and even in the recall of complex eyewitness events (Shaw, Bjork, & Handal, 1995). These observations of long- lasting retrieval- based impairment, together with research on output interference in episodic recall (Roediger, 1974; Roediger & Schmidt, 1980; Smith, 1971, 1973; Tulving & Arbuckle, 1963) and semantic recall (Blaxton & Neely, 1983), testify to the existence of a general process by which the act of recall reduces access to related memories (see also Dagenbach, Carr, & Barnhardt, 1990, and Schooler, Fiore, & Brandimonte, 1997, for related phe-"

It is possible that the mechanisms underlying retrieval- induced forgetting do not require effortful recall to have their detrimental impact. For instance, many models of interference predict that strengthening the representation of an item by any means (e.g., retrieval practice or additional study) should block retrieval access to related items (see, e.g., Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1988; Rundus, 1973). These models reflect a long tradition of research on associative competition mechanisms as a source of interference (see Anderson & Bjork, 1994, and Anderson & Neely, 1996, for reviews). Blocking of this sort may be thought of in terms of tip- of- the- tongue experiences, in which we forget a word or a name, presumably because of persistent intrusions of a highly accessible similar name (Baddeley, 1982; Jones, 1989; Reason & Lucas, 1984; Woodworth, 1938). Consistent with this view, studies using the retrieval practice procedure find that repeated retrieval facilitates later recall of the practiced items. If strengthening items through retrieval practice impairs access to related knowledge, other methods of strengthening (e.g., extra study time or extra repetitions) should be equally disruptive. A finding of impairment under these conditions would argue that recall may not be a necessary condition for this form of forgetting."

Consider the study by Anderson et al. (1994), mentioned previously. Although there was a general tendency for retrieval practice to impair the recall of related knowledge, the degree of impairment depended strongly on the degree to which related items interfered with the retrieval practice of target items. Across three experiments, significant retrieval- induced forgetting was seen for exemplars with high taxonomic frequency (e.g., fruit banana), but little or no impairment was found for low- frequency items (e.g., fruit guava). This difference in impairment occurred despite significant (and comparable) facilitation in the final recall of practiced items in the two conditions. Thus, the strengthening of practiced items, by itself, does not appear to cause retrieval- induced forgetting; rather, differences in impairment depend crucially on the strength of the unpracticed, related items. On the basis of these findings, Anderson et al. argued that when subjects perform retrieval practice (e.g., fruit orange), other exemplars also become activated in proportion to how strongly they are related to the category cue (e.g., banana becomes more activated than guava).

Notably, subjects' recall for items tested under the unpracticed category (food strawberry) was impaired even though the category cue was unrelated to the item that had been strengthened by retrieval practice (blood). Thus, the unpracticed category provided a measure of the accessibility of these related items that was independent of associative interference from the practiced targets. Anderson and Spellman argued that this evidence for cue- independent impairment supports the existence of an attentional inhibition process that suppresses competing items in order to focus the search for retrieval targets."

If inhibitory mechanisms are necessary to resolve retrieval interference, less inhibition should be necessary when subjects do not have to retrieve anything (Anderson & Spellman, 1995). For instance, more inhibition should be observed when subjects actively recall to- be- practiced items from incomplete cues (e.g., fruit or ____) than when subjects are merely presented with the to- be- practiced items for additional study. Although subjects may sometimes covertly recall the earlier presentation of an item when it is presented again to them for additional study (Atkinson & Juola, 1974; Jacoby, 1991; Mandler, 1980), the substantial amount of additional cue information available during such representations is likely to greatly reduce interference from related knowledge. Thus, if extra study repetitions present little opportunity to resolve retrieval interference, little inhibition of related memories should occur. That is, even if extra presentations strengthen the repeated items substantially, little impairment should be observed."

These possibilities seem unlikely, however, in light of findings that support the existence of a recall- dependent forgetting process. For example, in a study of semantic retrieval, Blaxton and Neely (1983) found that subjects were slower to generate a critical target exemplar from semantic memory (e.g., fruit a__). after they had generated four other prime exemplars from that same category (e.g., fruit o__). In contrast, subjects were faster, not slower, to generate the same target exemplar when the prime items were presented intact to subjects for speeded naming (e.g., fruit orange). If presenting related primes was enough to impair semantic recall of target exemplars, comparable slowing should have been found in both the generate- prime and the read- prime conditions. The key difference between these two forms of prime trial is that in the generate- prime case, subjects had to recall prime items from incomplete retrieval cues, in the face of interference from other similar exemplars- - a situation likely to trigger inhibition, and a situation strongly resembling that present in the retrieval practice paradigm."

The experiment concerned how well subjects could recall a first list of words after having studied several intervening word lists to varying degrees. In the low- interpolation condition, the subjects studied these additional lists at a rate of 2 sec per item, whereas the subjects in the high- interpolation condition studied the lists at a rate of 5 sec per item. After learning the intervening lists, the subjects recalled the initial study list, followed by the additional lists. An abundance of prior work has shown substantial increases in retroactive interference as a function of additional learning on intervening lists (Barnes & Underwood, 1959; see Postman, 1971, for a review). However, most of these classical interference studies used the method of anticipation, in which subjects learn a study list by repeated study- test cycles. As Anderson et al. (1994) noted, this method of learning confounds the amount of intervening learning with the number of opportunities (on test trials) that subjects have in which to suppress responses from the first study list. By manipulating the degree of intervening learning through variations in study time, Bäuml (1996) was able to separate out the effects of additional learning from retrieval practice. Importantly, although Bäuml's (1996) manipulation of study time created strong differences in the final recall of interpolated material, retroactive interference did not vary with the degree of interpolated learning, unlike in classical studies. Thus, there is ample precedent for believing that strengthening study items does not impair the recall of related material, at least in the retroactive interference paradigm (for similar findings in the contexts of proactive interference and of the list strength effect, see DaPolito, 1966, and Bäuml, 1997, respectively)."

First, Blaxton and Neely never measured the degree to which prime exemplars were strengthened by either naming or generation. Because we do not know how much the primes were strengthened, we cannot be sure whether the greater impairment in the generate- prime condition was produced by recall- specific inhibitory processes or by greater strengthening of the generated primes. If generated primes were strengthened more than named primes, greater impairment of target items might reflect increased competition from the primes. Second, although Bäuml's (1996) study shows that variations in strengthening caused by increases in study time did not lead to differences in retroactive interference, it did not directly demonstrate that recall does cause variations in impairment. Thus, Bäuml's (1996) study can only speak indirectly to the importance of the recall process in initiating inhibitory mechanisms."

As in the competitive retrieval practice condition, subjects were asked to respond to retrieval practice trials by writing down both the category name and the exemplar. Thus, both groups practiced the same category exemplars for the same number of times, both had to recall something during practice, and both had to write down exactly the same responses.

For this reason, it is critical to control the final recall order of exemplars within each category, if we are to evaluate whether retrieval- induced forgetting is recall specific. When subjects are free to recall items in any order, they often recall the stronger practiced items first (Anderson et al., 1994; see also Bousfield & Barclay, 1950; Tulving & Hastie, 1972; Wixted, Ghadisha, & Vera, 1997). Thus, any remaining nonprac­ ticed members will be recalled later, on average, than baseline items, subjecting them to greater output inter­ ference. So, even if nonpracticed members were not sup­ pressed by noncompetitive retrieval practice, the sub­ stantial facilitation of practiced items in that condition may cause retrieval- based suppression during the final test (see Anderson et al., 1994; Bauml, 1996, 1997, 1998). These output order biases might lead one mistakenly to conclude that reexposing exemplars during retrieval prac­ tice was sufficient to suppress related items."

This procedure allows us to ask subjects to recall first all the unpracticed items in a category, fol­ lowed by practiced items, or vice versa. By examining retrieval- induced forgetting for items tested in the first half of a category test, we can measure the effects of the earlier retrieval practice phase in a way that is unconta­ minated by output interference from the final recall of practiced items. If repeatedly presenting exemplars in the earlier practice phase is enough to suppress related items, we should observe impairment in the noncompetitive re­ trieval practice condition. More specifically, impairment should appear not only in overall recall performance, but also when related items are tested in the first half of a category test, showing that such impairment is not a product of output interference. If, on the other hand, sup­ pression is tied to the need to resolve interference during retrieval practice, impairment should only occur in the competitive retrieval practice condition; as in Anderson et al. and Anderson and McCulloch (1999), such impair­ ment should occur not only in overall recall, but also for items tested in the first half of a category test."

For competitive retrieval practice subjects, each page displayed a category and the first two letters of an item (e.g., dogs co_). In contrast, for noncompetitive retrieval practice subjects, pages displayed the first two letters of a category and a completed exemplar (e.g., fr_ orange). Aside from this variation, the booklets were identical in format. All the booklets tested three exemplars from each of four categories. Each of the 12 items was tested three times, according to an expanding schedule; on average, 3.5 items intervened between the first and the second practice test, and 6.5 items between the second and the third. No two items from a category were tested adjacently, and we avoided repeated sequences of particular test items. Tests of filler categories were used to make it easier to honor these constraints and to control for primacy and recency effects, yielding a booklet containing 48 test pages in total."

Categories were tested with one exemplar per test page, in six- item blocks, by cuing with the category and a single- letter stem (e.g., dog c_). To control for output interference, the average test positions of practiced and baseline categories were matched. The order of particular categories was also counterbalanced so that, across subjects, the position of every category was equated. Finally, the order of items within each category was counterbalanced: For half of the subjects, items a, b, and c were tested in the first half of a category test, and for the remaining subjects, in the second half. This control ensured that all the items contributed to test order and retrieval practice combinations (e.g., practiced- first, practiced"

In the competitive retrieval practice condition, the subjects were told that each page contained a category with the first two letters of a studied exemplar, which they were both to recall and to write down within 7 sec, along with the category name. They were warned that items would be tested several times and that they should try to write the correct item each time. In the noncompetitive retrieval practice condition, the subjects were given similar instructions, except that they were told that they would be recalling the category that went with the provided exemplar. After the retrieval practice phase, the subjects did a reasoning task for the 20- min retention interval."

This reduction in impairment contrasts with previous studies using this procedure, which have consistently found inhibition in both testing positions (e.g., Anderson et al., 1994; Anderson & McCulloch, 1999). The reasons for reduced impairment in this particular study are unclear. It is possible that impairment was reduced by integration effects, such as those documented in recent work on retrievalinduced forgetting (Anderson & McCulloch, 1999).Perhaps by recalling practiced items in the first testing positions, subjects accessed inter exemplar retrieval routes "

However, when the subjects were presented with the same to- be- practiced items and were asked to recall the category name (e.g., fr. orange), delayed recall of related exemplars was unimpaired. Thus, although both groups received the same number of practice trials and gave exactly the same practice responses, related items were only impaired when the subjects actively had to recall the practice targets. These findings are compatible with the idea (Anderson et al., 1994; Anderson & Spellman, 1995) that inhibitory processes underlie retrieval- induced forgetting and, in particular, that these processes help to resolve interference during recall."

The present findings extend that work by showing that even when the type of unpracticed competitor is held constant (high- frequency exemplars), significant strengthening of practiced items does not cause impairment if practice does not require the resolution of retrieval interference. Together with the findings of Bäuml (1996) concerning retroactive interference and those of Blaxton and Neely (1983) in the domain of semantic retrieval, the present findings thus argue for a special role of recall in the inhibition of related knowledge."

More strengthening in the competitive practice condition might be expected, for instance, on the basis of work showing that retrieval practice facilitates later recall more than does simple reexposure of an item (e.g., Bjork, 1975; Carrier & Pashler, 1992; Gardiner et al., 1973). If competitive practice strengthened items more, related items might be more impaired, even if retrieval- induced forgetting is not recall specific. This hypothesis seems unlikely for several reasons. First, even if differences in strengthening went undetected by our final recall test, the substantial and statistically equivalent facilitation that did occur in the noncompetitive practice condition should have caused at least some impairment, but it did not. This lack of impairment seems unlikely if strengthening plays an important causal role "

If recall order had not been controlled through the use of our category stem cued- recall procedure, it is possible that both forms of retrieval practice would have caused some impairment of unpracticed exemplars. This outcome is likely because both types of practice strengthen practiced items (as is shown in the present results), which makes it likely that those items will be recalled first on a final recall test in which recall order is left uncontrolled. Such biases in recall order for practiced items have the potential to cause test- based retrieval- induced forgetting (output interference), making it seem as though repeated presentation was sufficient to cause long- lasting impairment. By using a letter stem cued- recall procedure, we were able to compare unpracticed exemplars that were tested first in their category with comparable items in the baseline categories. Replicating Anderson et al. (1994), competitive retrieval practice caused significant retrieval- induced forgetting when output order was controlled. Under identical test conditions, however, repeated presentations of competing exemplars had little effect on the recall of related items. These findings strongly support the idea that retrieval- induced forgetting reflects the enduring effects of the earlier retrieval practice phase and not test- based competition from stronger practiced items (Anderson et al., 1994)."

However, several authors have provided evidence favoring an alternative interpretation in terms of strategy disruption (Basden & Basden, 1995; Sloman, Bower, & Roher, 1991). By this view, presenting part- set cues encourages a reorganization (or reinterpretation) of the items in the cue set, which diverts subjects from using the retrieval strategies they formed during the initial study phase. To the extent that the new organization conflicts with the earlier one, subjects receiving part- set cues may be at a disadvantage relative to uncued subjects. The present study suggests that strategy disruption may be a better explanation for the effects of part- set cues, inasmuch as the conditions thought necessary to induce blocking- the strengthening of cues- - failed to cause impairment in our noncompetitive practice condition. Alternatively, part- set cuing may impair the noncue items indirectly, by leading subjects to recall the cues (overtly or covertly) earlier during the recall test. Thus, noncues may simply suffer more output interference when cues are presented (Karchmer & Winograd, 1971)."

Rather, it is only when related knowledge interferes during an attempt to recall something else that it may be inhibited. If inhibitory processes are specifically tied to recall, it suggests a different perspective on why we sometimes feel limited in the amount of knowledge we can sustain in a highly accessible state. Inevitably, when we try to learn new items, such as names, numbers, or words, we assess our success at encoding the new knowledge by seeing whether or not we can recollect it- by administering self- tests (e.g., \"What's his/her name again?\"). Although such self- tests can be very effective at enhancing the retrieval of newly acquired information, that accessibility may come at the price of inhibiting other highly retrievable knowledge. Thus, it may not be the encoding of new student names but, rather, their retrieval that led David Starr Jordan to forget his fish."

For instance, the retrieval practice cue format (e.g., fruit or _) arguably matched the final test cue format more in the competitive condition (e.g., fruit or _) than in the noncompetitive condition (e.g., fr_orange). However, previous work has shown that a high degree of match between practice and test cues is not in itself sufficient to produce retrieval-induced forgetting (see Anderson et al., 1994, Experiments 2 and 3)."
