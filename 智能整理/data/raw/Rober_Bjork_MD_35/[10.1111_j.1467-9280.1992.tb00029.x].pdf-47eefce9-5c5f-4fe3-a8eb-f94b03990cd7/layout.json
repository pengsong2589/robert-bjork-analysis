The goal of training in real- world settings is, or should be, to support two aspects of posttraining performance: (a) the level of performance in the long term and (b) the capability to transfer that training to related tasks and altered contexts. The implicit or explicit assumption of those persons responsible for training is that the procedures that enhance performance and speed improvement during training will necessarily achieve these two goals. However, a variety of experiments on motor and verbal learning indicate that this assumption is often incorrect. Manipulations that maximize performance during training can be detrimental in the long term; conversely, manipulations that degrade the speed of acquisition can support the long- term goals of training. The fact that there are parallel findings in the motor and verbal domains suggests that principles of considerable generality can be deduced to upgrade training procedures."

For example, increasing the frequency of information presented to learners about performance errors during practice improves performance during training, yet can degrade performance on a test of long- term retention or transfer. Increasing the amount of task variability required during practice, in contrast, depresses performance during training, yet facilitates performance on later tests of the ability to generalize training to altered conditions. Such findings challenge common views of skill learning. Compared with some baseline training condition, how can a factor that enhances performance in practice interfere with retention or transfer performance? Even more intriguing, how can another factor that de "

These views of learning, though flawed in our opinion, have had a strong influence on the design of learning environments in educational, industrial, and military contexts. We then illustrate those flaws with examples from three different research paradigms, and we argue for a set of processes occurring during practice that can, at least in general terms, account for such findings."

The major learning theorists of an earlier era recognized decades ago that experimental variables applied during training can have two distinct kinds of effects (see, e.g., Estes, 1955; Guthrie, 1952; Hull, 1942; Skinner, 1938; Tolman, 1932). First, of course, such variables can have the relatively permanent effects that are the usual focus when learning is examined. That is, these variables might speed the development of some relatively permanent capability for responding (the usual definition of learning, and the one we use here), so that a group of subjects with more of this capability will usually perform more effectively during practice than a group with less of this capability. Second, however, there may also be temporary effects of such experimental manipulations—effects that exaggerate or diminish performance differences while the variables are operating, with these performance differences vanishing or being markedly altered as soon as the subjects are allowed to rest, or when the manipulation is removed. Such performance effects can be mediated by a host of factors, such as the elevating effects of motivational instructions or the administration of feedback, as well as the depressing effects of physical (or mental) fatigue and boredom. A given experimental manipulation can have either or both of these learning and performance effects."

For us to agree that one level of some variable has produced more learning than another, we usually demand that these differences have some permanence across time, or that the differences be able to survive the removal of the manipulation in question. The problem is to discover which of many possible practice variables produce learning effects in the sense just defined—that is, to determine whether a given independent variable has effects that are relatively permanent or are merely transitory."

Assume that two groups of subjects practice under different levels of some independent variable during an acquisition phase. For example, they might be learning foreign vocabulary words, with frequency of feedback being manipulated (after every trial vs. after every fifth trial). Differences between groups during the acquisition phase could reflect differences in learning or performance (or both). It is critical, therefore, to add a retention phase (sometimes called a transfer phase), conducted after an interpolated interval that is long enough to ensure that any temporary effects of the independent variable have been dissipated. If subjects are then tested on the same (or similar) task again under equated levels of the independent variable (so that differential temporary effects cannot reappear across trials), relative performance differences between the two groups can be viewed with some confidence as reflecting differential learning that occurred during the acquisition phase."

First, while instructors have ample opportunity to view their students during practice, they frequently do not have a chance to examine their learners on the transfer or retention tests that are the real goal of training. Such posttraining performance is often delayed or in a different location than the original training. Second, instructors can also be misled by their own trainees: In a study of learning keyboard skills under different practice schedules (Baddeley & Longman, 1978), for example, the schedules that were most preferred by subjects produced the least learning."

Note that this is quite a different view from that often taken in educational and training settings, where learning and retention are seen as two different phenomena. \"Learning\" is assumed to refer to that set of processes occurring during the actual practice on the tasks of interest, as assessed by performance measures taken at that time, whereas \"retention\" is seen to involve the set of processes that occur after practice is completed, during some retention interval, and prior to a retention test. Because learning and retention are thought to be different phenomena, they tend to be studied with separate methods, by different scientists, and even in different laboratories. Rather than viewing learning and posttraining retention as separable phenomena, however, we argue that the effectiveness of learning is revealed by, or measured by, the level of retention shown."

Whereas it is important to be able to perform the specific skill acquired in practice some months later in a retention test, it is also important to be able to generalize to variations of that skill, perhaps to be performed in contexts different from those experienced in acquisition. For example, the trainee might have to generalize the skill acquired under quiet, controlled conditions in a classroom to a noisy, hot, and cluttered environment in the workplace. The capability to perform in the presence of stress, sleep loss, or fatigue may be critical in some situations, and the need to perform a simultaneous secondary task effectively may be important as well. There may also be a need to have learning generalize to other learning environments, allowing new tasks to be learned more quickly and easily. The acquisition condition that is most effective—given these criteria—is the one leading to the highest performance on a novel version of the task, or on a task performed or practiced under novel conditions. Thus, rather than thinking of learning and generalizability as separate concepts—as is often done—we interpret the capability to generalize as one measure of learning, and as a basis for selecting among various training conditions."

What is new, however, is the notion that the training conditions to achieve these training goals are not necessarily those that maximize performance in the acquisition phase. In fact, as we show next, there can be conditions for which the effectiveness of training—as measured by one or another of these alternative criteria—is best achieved by a condition that produces relatively poor performances during training."

A second example involves variations in the nature and scheduling of feedback for learning, again with the emphasis on enhancing a retention criterion. Finally, a third example involves inducing variation among versions of the tasks"

Random practice, in contrast, involved the same number of trials at the three tasks, but the order was randomized so that a given task was never practiced on successive trials. Thus, blocked practice resembles what we usually term drill. The tasks required rapid, multiple- component arm movements, with the goal of minimizing response time, and different tasks had different patterns. After practice in an acquisition phase, retention tests were given after "

During the acquisition phase, at the left, there was a clear advantage for the subjects who practiced under the blocked conditions, especially in the initial phases of practice, but continuing until the last acquisition block. Amount of learning, however, as measured by the tests of posttraining retention, tells a different story. Consider first the tests given under the random conditions, shown as the filled and open squares. There was a strong advantage for retention for the subjects who practiced under the random conditions in acquisition. That is, even though the random conditions were less effective during the acquisition phase, they were better than the blocked conditions on the random retention test. These differences are especially impressive given the ecological validity of random tests; that is, most real- world behaviors are not produced in blocked contexts."

One exception is that at minimal levels of practice, blocked practice produces better retention than does random practice, but this effect is reversed with additional levels of practice (Shea, Kohl, & Indermill, 1990). These phenomena, and various theoretical interpretations thereof, have been reviewed recently by Magill and Hall (1990)."

Here, the general problem is that distinct items presented serially are to be learned, and the question is how the study trials on a given item should be interleaved with the study trials on other items to generate maximal retention. In general, spacing of repetitions yields better long- term retention than does massing of repetitions- often much better. If the final retention interval is short, however, massed repetitions can yield better performance than spaced repetitions. (For examples of such interactions involving intervals ranging from seconds to minutes to days, respectively, see Peterson, Hillner, & Saltzman, 1962; Glenberg, 1979;Glenberg & Lehmann, 1980; and Bahrick, 1979. ) The interaction of spacing interval and retention interval may again mislead people responsible for training; on the basis of performance during acquisition alone, massed repetitions may appear to be superior to spaced repetitions."

Two experiments (Landauer & Bjork, 1978) examined how such retrieval efforts should be scheduled to optimize long- term retention. In the first experiment, subjects were asked to learn a number of names of hypothetical people. During the study phase, a given name was presented once and then tested three times (by presenting the first name as a cue for the last name or the last name as a cue for the first name). The intervals from the initial presentation of a given name to each successive test of that name were filled with different numbers of intervening presentations and tests of other names. Following the study phase, there was a 30- min retention interval filled with a distracting activity prior to a final retention test for all the names."

During the acquisition phase, after an initial pairing of a given name and face, there were four subsequent tests of that face- name combination, each of which consisted of presenting the face and the first (or second) name as a cue for the missing name. The intervals separating the successive tests of a given name formed an expanding sequence (0, 1, 3, and 8 intervening events) or a uniform sequence with the same average interval length (3, 3, 3, and 3 intervening items), and there was again a test of final retention after a 30- min delay. On the final test, each face was shown alone, and subjects were asked to recall both the first and last name corresponding to that face."

In fact, for the expanding condition, the retention of a name presented only once (and tested four times) was greater than retention of a name presented—together with a given face—five times (66% vs. 58% correct). This result illustrates the general principle that tests are potent learning events—often more potent than presentations—particularly when the tests are difficult enough to constitute a type of retrieval practice with respect to the criterial retention test. There are analogous results in the motor memory literature. For example, Hagman (1983), using an arm- positioning task, found that four test trials that involved attempting to repeat a once- presented position were more effective for retention than were four presentation trials in which the subject moved to a stop defining the target position."

Such effects of expanding- interval retrieval practice in the verbal domain seem quite closely related to another effect we discuss in the next major section- namely, the scheduling of the number of practice trials between presentations of feedback in skill learning."

It has generally been understood that any variation of feedback in practice that makes the information more immediate, more accurate, more frequent, or more useful for modifying behavior will contribute to learning, as measured during the acquisition phase. This view of the relationship of feedback and learning has served as the basis for instructional practice in many settings, as well as for the design of simulators. Recent evidence, however, suggests that this generalization must be qualified."

In one condition, feedback about the movement time error was given after each trial, a more or less standard schedule typically thought to optimize learning. Feedback was also given in summary form (see Lavery, 1962), in which the subject received feedback about each of a set of trials (e.g., 5) only after the last trial in the set was completed. This feedback was given in the form of a graph of performance against each of the trials in the set, so that the subject could see the error on each of the previous trials. The summary length—the number of trials summarized on the graph—was either 1 (the every- trial feedback condition mentioned earlier), 5, or 15 trials. After practice under these conditions in an acquisition phase, subjects were given tests of posttraining retention (without any feedback) after 10 min and 2 days."

In the acquisition phase, subjects in the 1- trial summary condition performed more accurately throughout practice than the other groups, with generally larger errors being produced as the summary length increased. It is clear that increased summary length interfered with performance during training, both in slowing the rate of approach to the asymptote and in generating larger errors near the end of practice. However, when performance was evaluated on the delayed retention test, the most effective performance was generated by the 15- trial group, with generally increasing errors as the summary length in the acquisition phase decreased. That is, there was a clear negative relationship between the level of performance in acquisition and the level of performance in retention. These data tend to contradict the long- held view that making feedback more useful is effective for learning, as the 15- trial condition seemed to provide dif"

In the latter, 50%, condition, the feedback was faded, such that feedback was given on every trial early in practice and gradually withdrawn across practice. Retention performance was measured after 10 min and 2 days, either with or without feedback being presented (in separate experiments). In both experiments, the 100% and 50%- faded groups were essentially similar in the acquisition phase. But on the posttraining retention tests, the 50%- faded group had more effective performance, with the differences becoming larger as the retention interval increased. These data contradict traditional views of feedback operation in that providing half the number of feedback presentations in acquisition produced more effective retention performance. The general finding that expanded spacing of feedback presentations enhanced retention is analogous to the finding (Landauer & Bjork, 1978) that expanded spacing of repetitions was more effective for name learning, suggesting again that some common features underlie these two paradigms."

All of these studies, unfortunately, have characteristics that prevent them from being compared directly with the work just mentioned on motor behavior. For example, practice was always provided until a particular criterion was reached (e.g., 100% correct); because improvement in acquisition was faster with more frequent feedback, this procedure confounded the percentage feedback in acquisition with the amount of practice. Also, delayed retention tests were never given, which is unfortunate in view of the motor findings that the benefits of infrequent feedback seem to increase with the longer retention intervals (see, e.g., Fig. 3). Even so, several of these studies suggest that reducing the percentage feedback in acquisition—in some cases from 100% to 0%—has negligible effects on performance in immediate retention (Krumboltz & Weisman, 1962; Schulz & Runquist, 1960), suggesting a rough parallel to the work in motor behavior."

But it also provides some disadvantages (see Schmidt, 1991a). One possibility is that frequent feedback comes to be a part of the task, so that performance is disrupted in retention when the feedback is removed or altered. Also, frequent feedback could block information processing activities that are important during the acquisition phase for acquiring the capability to produce effective performance at retention. One possibility is that frequent feedback blocks the processing of response- produced (kinesthetic) feedback, leading to less effective error- detection capabilities for use in retention (Schmidt et al., 1989). Another possibility is that frequent feedback makes performance too variable during practice, preventing the learning of a stabilized representation of the kind necessary to sustain performance on a later retention test."

For example, Kerr and Booth (1978) had 8- year- old subjects toss beanbags to targets 2 ft and 4 ft away (variable group) or only to a target 3 ft away (constant group). On a subsequent test using the 3- ft target—the distance practiced by the constant group, but never practiced by the variable group—the variable group performed with greater accuracy than the constant group. This result suggests that learning how to modulate the relationships among the target distances was more important for a test at any one target than was specific experience, even at the particular target distance used at test."

Constant contexts were more effective than variable contexts for enabling subjects to identify the concept in the same context as it was presented earlier, and were probably more effective in the acquisition phase as well.

Learning is obscured during the acquisition (or practice) phase because relatively permanent effects may be confounded with temporary performance effects that disappear quickly after the practice session is finished, or when the test conditions are changed. We advocate, therefore, the use of various kinds of transfer or retention tests on which (and only on which) the relatively permanent effects of the conditions in acquisition are evaluated. We have provided three experimental variations of practice in which conditions that facilitate performance during the acquisition phase are ineffective for learning as measured on a retention or transfer test. In each of those cases, there appear to be analogous effects across markedly different motor- and verbal- learning paradigms."

If these processing activities are selected so that they are also needed for success at a test of retention or generalizability, then such conditions will facilitate learning."

Note that the overlap of relevant processes does not necessarily mean that there is overlap of the objective conditions of practice, as we have shown here several times already. If certain acquisition conditions force the learner to engage in processes that are also critical for test performance, then those conditions will be judged as effective for learning (because they facilitate test performance), even though they may exhibit different superficial conditions. Also, these conditions that maximize learning may not be very effective for performance during the acquisition phase, as they provide various \"difficulties\" for the learners. Random practice, reduced feedback, and variable practice all degrade performance during practice relative to more \"ideal\" conditions in acquisition, yet all can be argued to exercise information processing activities that are critical for performance at the test. In other words, these conditions can be considered as effective for learning because they prepare the learner for the processing that will be required at test."

Even so, these data suggest a new conceptualization, or framework, for learning and training that has broad implications for educational practice (see, e.g., Christina & Bjork, 1991). From a practical perspective, this framework would stress that a trainer's major goal is to focus clearly on the criterion performance, and to understand what kinds of processes are required for its proficiency. Then, practice activities that exercise these particular processes could be designed (see, e.g., Schmidt, 1991b, chap. 11). The criteria version of many tasks, for example, involves the execution of an essentially novel response that cannot have been practiced previously, such as the solution of a particular mathematical word problem on the job, or the execution of a basketball shot from a location never before experienced. In such cases, practice could be organized in a way to facilitate transfer and generalization, and a form of variable practice would be recommended. Other practice conditions would optimize performance in other contexts, as we have argued here."
