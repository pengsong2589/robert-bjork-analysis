Compared with massing, spacing enhances long- term recall, but we expected spacing to hamper induction by making the commonalities that define a concept or category less apparent. We asked participants to study multiple paintings by different artists, with a given artist's paintings presented consecutively (massed) or interleaved with other artists' paintings (spaced). We then tested induction by asking participants to indicate which studied artist (Experiments 1a and 1b) or whether any studied artist (Experiment 2) painted each of a series of new paintings. Surprisingly, induction profited from spacing, even though massing apparently created a sense of fluent learning: Participants rated massing as more effective than spacing, even after their own test performance had demonstrated the opposite."

The positive effects of spacing on long- term recall are large and robust, and have been demonstrated in a variety of domains, such as conditioning (even in animals as simple as Aplysia; see Carew, Pinsker, & Kandel, 1972), verbal learning (e.g., Bahrick, Bahrick, Bahrick, & Bahrick, 1993; Ebbinghaus, 1885/1964), motor learning (e.g., Shea & Morgan, 1979), and "

There were four categories of drawings that participants learned to identify; for example, a \"Kem\" was defined as a drawing containing a circle positioned near the top of the display.

In such experiments, the spacing effect appears to diminish or disappear altogether for nonverbatim repetitions (e.g., Appleton- Knapp, Bjork, & Wickens, 2005; Dellarosa & Bourne, 1985; Glover & Corkill, 1987). Similarly, Melton (1970) demonstrated that spacing effects do not occur when participants fail to recognize that a repeated item is a repetition. Given such findings, and given that inductive learning involves exposure to a variety of different exemplars and does not involve exact repetition, it seems possible that spacing effects will disappear or turn into massing effects in tasks requiring induction."

Learning a motor skill, such as a tennis serve, involves induction in the sense that exposure to one's own proprioceptive feedback is an important component of learning—and such repetitions are, by necessity, not exact, especially for novices learning complex skills. Although spaced practice is effective in many areas of motor learning (e.g., Shea & Morgan, 1979), massed practice can be more effective for learning complex motor skills (Wulf & Shea, 2002)."

Such massing illusions may derive from the fact that metacognitive judgments are often grounded in feelings of fluency (e.g., see Benjamin, Bjork, & Schwartz, 1998). Presenting the same item twice consecutively makes processing the second presentation seem highly fluent, providing a (misleading) impression of learning, whereas spacing decreases the fluency of processing the second presentation. In other words, massing provides a sense of "

In Experiment 1a, spacing was manipulated within participants: Paintings by each of 6 of the artists were presented massed, and paintings by each of the other 6 artists were presented spaced. In Experiment 1b, spacing was manipulated between participants: For a given participant, the paintings were presented either all massed by painter or all interleaved (spaced). After the learning phase, participants were shown new paintings by the same 12 artists and asked to select, from a list of all the artists' names, the artist who had painted each new painting. After the test, participants in Experiment 1a were asked what presentation condition, massing or spacing, they felt had been more effective for learning a given artist's style."

It seems possible that participants did indeed induce an artist's style more effectively in the massed condition than in the spaced condition, but recalled the name associated with that style better in the spaced condition. Experiment 2 was designed to test that possibility by assessing participants' recognition, not recall, so that they did not need to remember name- style associations."

For example, the induction for each artist may have been \"done\" by the third study trial, so that the next three study trials amounted to either massed or spaced memory practice. To test this possibility, we conducted an additional experiment. The test phase was the same as in Experiment 2, but in the study phase, only two paintings by each artist (instead of six) were presented. We obtained the same pattern of results: There was a significant benefit of spaced study, but participants thought massed study had been more effective."

For example, the key to deciding whether a tree is a maple or an oak (or some other tree) is learning to appreciate the differences among trees, not learning about a given type of tree in isolation. Interleaving had the effect of juxtaposing different paintings and therefore might have enhanced discrimination learning. (In fact, we have presented no evidence regarding the effects of temporal spacing in the absence of interleaving, and it may be interleaving, not spacing itself, that is the key to enhancing inductive learning.)"

Thus, if discrimination is not difficult, as was the case in Kurtz and Hovland's experiment, massing may be advantageous, but if discrimination is difficult, as it was in our experiments, spacing might be more effective."

The design was similar to the design of Experiment 1a—that is, half of the sets that defined a to- be- remembered word were presented massed, whereas the other half were presented spaced—and 20 undergraduate participants were tested. In this case, spacing made it nearly impossible to solve the problems, and, thus, later memory for the target words was significantly better in the massed condition than in the spaced condition (.34 vs. .22), "

The illusion of effective learning in the massed condition, based, apparently, on a sense of fluency of induction, was clearly powerful in the experiments presented here.

That is, most people are likely to prefer massing in inductive- learning situations, but our results suggest that they may do so at their own (and their students' and children's) peril from a learning standpoint."

In the case of induction, as in many other types of learning, spacing appears to be sometimes, if not always, a desirable difficulty (Bjork, 1994)."
