Such \"generation effects\" have been attributed to the activation or strengthening of response- specific features in memory and to the activation or strengthening of the relation between a stimulus and response. This series of experiments yields evidence suggesting that both mechanisms are involved. The pattern of interactions in the size of the generation effect across type of recall test (cued or free) cannot be accommodated by any one- factor theory. The results of these experiments also suggest that within- subjects manipulations of read and generate study conditions inflate the apparent size of the effect of generation on a given pair by confounding such pair- specific effects with certain whole- list effects, such as differential attention and output interference."

All such explanations, however, appear to be discredited by Slamecka and Graf's (1978) finding that there is no generation advantage (when a rhyme rule is used) in recognition memory for the stimulus term. This finding discredits effort- type theories because one would expect the stimulus term, especially with an associative rule, to be as deeply or as effortfully processed as the response term. Damaging the effort explanations further are the failures to find the effect with nonsense syllables, which are presumably processed effortfully. (See, however, Nairne & Widner, 1987, for a dissenting view on the failure to find the generation effect with nonsense syllables.)"

On the basis of data from their experiment requiring subjects to carry out a semantic adequacy check, Donaldson and Bass claimed the generation effect occurs because, following generation, subjects routinely perform such a semantic adequacy check, whereas simple reading does not incorporate such a check. Examining semantic appropriateness presumably strengthens the relation from the stimulus to the response term. McElroy and Slamecka (1982) have criticized this conclusion because the adequacy check raised the scores of both the read and generate subjects, which raises the question of why the generate group received a benefit from the postgeneration adequacy check if they had carried out this check as an intrinsic part of the generation process. The failure to find a generation effect on the stimulus term further damages Donaldson and Bass's hypothesis because the adequacy check hypothesis claims that additional effort or attention is also devoted to the stimulus term."

According to this lexical activation hypothesis, the generation effect occurs because generation produces greater activation of an item's semantic attributes than does reading. The work of Gardiner and his colleagues has indicated that the hypothesis extends to any familiar concept, not just lexical entries. A variant of this hypothesis is Nairne et al.'s (1985) suggestion that the effect is due to the activation of an item's associates: an idea based on their failure to find a generation effect in recognition with low- frequency words."

On the basis of recent evidence it now appears that a relational explanation is not sufficient. Glisky and Rabinowitz (1985) found a generation effect in recognition when single words were the to- be- generated items, a result that is clearly a problem for theories based solely on relational factors. Similarly, Gardiner and Hampton (1985) have shown a generation effect in free recall using a letter or number transposition rule in which it seems unlikely that the stimulus term could act as a cue for the response term. Evidence such as this led Gardiner and Hampton to conclude \"what is now known about the generation effect strongly suggests that, in essence, the effect is due to item- specific rather than relational processing\" (p. 740)."

The first goal of our experiments is to answer that question. The traditional Slamecka and Graf (1978) paradigm was implemented in a form designed to maximize the possibility of finding the effects of relational factors, if they exist. Toward that end, related rather than unrelated pairs were used, and the nature of the relation was associative, because such encoding would seem to depend more heavily on relational information than would a rhyme or transposition rule. In addition, both free- and cued- recall tasks were used because it was thought they would be differentially affected by relational and item- specific factors."

Consistent with the classic view (Underwood & Schulz, 1960) that cued- recall tests involve response learning and associative learning, we assume that both item- specific and relational factors contribute to the generation effect in cued recall. In free recall, however, we assume that only the item- specific factor causes the generation effect. The bases for this assumption are the findings of Hayes- Roth (1977) and Yekovich and Manelis (1980), which demonstrate that as strings of items become more strongly related, free recall of items within these strings is reduced. Generalizing these results to the paired- associate learning paradigm, we assume that the stronger relation between the stimulus and response which results from generating the response, does not help, and can even hurt, later free recall of the generated response. Consistent with this assumption, responses that are third associates of the stimulus terms are better free recalled than responses that are third associates of the stimulus terms in the present experiments."

Encoding task (reading or generating) and type of test (free or cued recall) were manipulated between subjects. A further variable, whether the response word was a first or third associate (Palermo & Jenkins, 1964) of the stimulus, was manipulated within- subjects. This variable was included to determine if, as discussed earlier, cued recall is more sensitive to relational factors than is free recall. If it is, there should be an advantage of first over third associates in cued recall, and a lesser advantage, if any, of first associates over third associates in free recall."

In one list, the odd- numbered stimulus words (in terms of list position) were paired with their first associates and the even- numbered words were paired with their third associates; in the other list, the odd- numbered pairs were third associates and the even- numbered pairs were first associates.

Subjects in the read and generate conditions were given different instructions (without the other subjects being present).

Further, both the free- recall and cued- recall groups were tested at a 5- min retention interval."

That such a conclusion is warranted can be illustrated in the following fashion. Assume, as shown in Figure 1, that as a consequence of a given read or generate study trial a certain number of features are activated in memory. Across items and subjects there will be a distribution of activated features in both cases owing to item variability and subject variability (both between subjects and within a given subject across trials as level of attention and effort varies). The upper panel in Figure 1 illustrates the case in which the two distributions are presumed to have equal variance (there is no a priori reason to assume otherwise). The lower panel illustrates the case in which the variance of the generate distribution is assumed to be smaller than the variance of the read distribution, a relation that turns out to be required by the results of Experiment 1. In either case, of course, the mean of the generate distribution is assumed to be higher than the mean of the read distribution, which is required by any one- factor item- specific explanation of the generation effect."

The finding in Experiments 1 and 2 that third associates are better free recalled than first associates supports the assumption that a stronger relation between the items in a pair does not increase, and can even inhibit the free recall of items in that pair."

A major problem with the foregoing account is that it is based on an empirical finding that conflicts with most of the published literature on the generation effect. Slamecka and Graf (1978), McFarland et al. (1980), Johnson et al. (1981), and Gardiner and Arthurs (1982) have reported large, reliable generation effects in free recall with similar materials and generation tasks to those we used. The primary difference between our experiments and those reported in the foregoing articles is our use of a between- subjects design. With one exception, every free recall experiment in the other articles used a within- subjects design. Interestingly, in the one experiment that used a between- subjects design, McFarland et al. (1980, Experiment 2B) found the effect of generation in free recall is approximately half the size of the effect of generation in their Experiment 1, a within- subjects design."

In the introduction we emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the pair- specific and whole- list effects of generation. Although most theoretical accounts focus on pair- specific effects (and generally ignore whole- list effects), whole- list effects do occur and are confounded with pair- specific effects. Specifically, in within- subjects designs, read and generate items compete for attentional resources and interfere with each other at output. Ignoring such factors leads to a systematic overestimation of the pair- specific effects of generation"

In Experiment 1 there was a read and generate version of each of the two lists presented to subjects. Experiment 4 manipulated encoding task within- subjects by exchanging items between the read and generate version of a given list. Specifically, the even- numbered items (in terms of list position) were switched between the read and generate versions of a given list. This produced a total of four lists. In two lists read items were in the odd- numbered list positions and generate items occupied the even- numbered list positions; for the other two lists the opposite was true. Furthermore, in two of the lists read items were third associates of their stimulus terms, whereas generate items were first associates of their stimulus terms. In the other two lists that assignment was reversed. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four lists. Across subjects, therefore, assignment of read versus generate task to list position, item type, and associative relation of that item were counterbalanced. Note that unlike the previous experiments, associative strength is not factorially crossed with encoding task and type of test in Experiment 4."

Second, the materials and procedures we used produced a large, reliable generation effect in free recall when a within- subjects design is used.

The effect of generation was larger in Experiment 4 (within subjects) than in Experiment 1 (between subjects) because the means of the read groups were much lower in Experiment 4 than in Experiment 1. This pattern occurred in free recall and, to a lesser extent, in cued recall. The free- recall mean in the read condition fell by .23, whereas the read- cued- recall mean fell by .18. These results are even more dramatic when the performance of the read group in the within- subjects design is represented as a percentage of the read group performance in the between- subjects design; in free recall the within- subjects mean is 33% of the between- subjects mean (.13 vs. .36). In cued recall, for the read condition, the within- subjects mean is 63% of the between- subjects mean (.48 vs. .66). This pattern indicates that the additional effects of generation that emerge in the within- subjects design operate to lessen performance on the read items. This outcome is consistent with Begg and Snider's (1987) claim that the presence of generate items in a list entails cursory processing of read items in that list, as well as with our claims that generate items compete with read items at encoding and output."

It is better at activating features of the response term in memory, and it strengthens the stimulus- response relation in memory. In addition, we assume the following. (a) Cued recall is sensitive primarily to stimulus- response strength but is facilitated by response activation as well. Such an assumption is consistent with the classic view that paired- associate learning involves response learning as well as stimulus- response association or \"hookup\" (cf. Underwood & Shulz, 1960). Consequently, the generation effect in cued recall is due to differences in stimulus- response strength and response activation between read and generated items. (b) Free recall of responses is sensitive primarily to response strength or activation and is inhibited rather than facilitated by stimulus- response strength. Such an assumption is based in part on prior evidence, cited earlier in this article that increased unitization (association) reduces access to components of the unit, and in part on the fact that the present data on free recall of first and third associates seem to demand such an assumption. Consequently, the generation effect in free recall of responses is due to response strength or activation, and is inhibited rather than facilitated by stimulus- response strength."

If one is interested in studying whole- list interactions of conditions on attentional and output processes, then a within- list procedure may be appropriate. If one's theorizing, on the other hand, focuses on the pair- specific effects of generation per se, then the within- list procedure confounds whole- list processes with the pair- specific processes of interest.

That the relational factor is potent, and specific to the particular relation strengthened at study, is indicated by the recent work of Rabinowitz and Craik (1986), who found that generating a response based on a semantic rule did not enhance cued recall over that of a read group when a rhyme cue was used at test. Thus, the response activation benefits of generation do not seem sufficient to create a generation effect in cued recall if the relational factor is nullified by the kind of change used by Rabinowitz and Craik."

Whereas we have emphasized response- specific activation and the strengthening of the relation from the stimulus term to the response term, Nairne et al., on the basis of the failure to find a generation effect with low- frequency words, argued that generation strengthens the relation from a response to its associates. This view does not seem fully compatible with our data. Because stimuli paired with first associates are much more likely to be high associates of their response terms than are stimuli paired with third associates, we would expect the generation effect in cued recall to be larger when first- associate stimuli are used as cues than when the third associate stimuli are used as cues. As will be discussed next, there is only marginal support for this position."

Looking only at the free- recall results of Experiments 1, 2, and 3 and the replication presented in the Discussion of Experiment 2, one could argue that the response activation effect of generation is greater for third associates. Across those four experiments, the average proportion of first associates recalled was .37 for read and .37 for generate, whereas the average proportion of third associates recalled was .42 for read and .52 for generate. Because only the response- activation factor contributes positively to free recall, and because the relational strengthening, which acts negatively, is, as will be argued next, equal across first and third associates, such a pattern of results suggests that the effect of generation on response activation is greater for third associates than for first associates."

The data- driven consequences of reading a response word versus generating that word appear to differ markedly. On nontraditional measures of memory that are particularly sensitive to data- driven processing, such as perceptual identification and word- fragment completion, there is the opposite effect of generation. Jacoby (1983) has demonstrated a stunning crossover interaction of study condition (read vs. generate) and type of final test (recognition vs. perceptual identification) characterized by an advantage of read over generate on the perceptual identification task. Blaxton (reported in Roediger & Blaxton, 1987) has obtained a similar crossover interaction with free recall and word- fragment completion as the final tasks."
