        "text": "A new parameters for characterization of the crack growth resistance for a power law hardening materials and structures under normal and elevated temperature are introduced in the form of plastic and creep stress intensity factors. A numerical method is proposed for estimating the governing parameter of the elastic- plastic and creep crack tip fields in the form of an  $I_{n}$ - integral along the through- the- thickness straight and curved crack fronts. Equations are also proposed for calculating the  $I_{n}$ - factor at both the deepest point along the crack front and the crack tip on the surface. Static and fatigue crack growth and in- plane and out- of- plane constraint effects are studied through experiments and computations for the material different properties. It is further demonstrated that for moderately large- scale yielding conditions or plastic deformations, the fracture process can be controlled by the single parameter  $K_{D}$  based on the elastic- plastic numerical solutions and, therefore, is reflected in the influence of the cracked body geometry and loading conditions. Keeping in mind the purpose of practical application of the introduced nonlinear stress intensity factors, an engineering approach to the prediction of residual lifetime of cracked steam turbine rotors components which operate at maintenance under cyclic loading conditions is proposed. Using the nonlinear stress intensity factors approximate estimations of carrying capacity are presented for the different stress- strain state of steam turbine disks at the operation. As result it is stated that a one- parameter approach based on the plastic and creep stress intensity factors are more convenient for practical use in assessing the fracture resistance under monotonic and cyclic loading of materials and structural elements with respect to the two parameters fracture theories.",

Note that the  $K_{P}$ - curves as a function of the relative crack length and specimen thickness in the mid- plane are close to each other for the different specimen geometries. Unlike the elastic SIF, the plastic stress intensity factor  $K_{P}$  in the formulation of Eq. (1) is sensitive enough to account for the influence of the specimen geometry (including of thickness) and the loading conditions. This opinion is supported by the experimental results presented in Fig. 1, where the values of plastic SIF correspond to the mid- plane of each specimen at  $z / B = 0.5$ . In contrast to the elastic SIF, the distributions of plastic SIF  $K_{P}$  as a function of relative crack length and specimen thickness exhibited a lower scatter average to  $K_{P} \\cong 0.61$ . Furthermore, this value of  $K_{P}$  is independent of the considered specimen geometry, i.e., it is a material characteristic. Thus, the plastic SIF may treated as a unified parameter for the characterization of the material fracture resistance property.",

(3). In general, as expected according to Eq.(5), the critical distance increases with an increase in the creep stress intensity factor. An overall reasonable correlation between the  $r_{cr} / a$  and  $\\overline{K}_{cr}$  is an indication that dominantly creep crack growth conditions were maintained throughout the testing. It is seen that the numerical data fall within a relatively narrow scatter band, and the dependence of the critical distance,  $r_{cr} / a$ , on  $\\overline{K}_{cr}$  follows a near linear trend on a log- log scale. It is clear that  $r_{cr} / a$  is not constant, but is the parameter depending on the loading conditions which are described by the creep stress intensity factor  $\\overline{K}_{cr}$ . Moreover, for the steels P2M and 12X1MF different properties takes place general relationship between a dimensionless parameters  $r_{cr} / a$ , and  $\\overline{K}_{cr}$ .",

The turbine disc is loaded, in general, by thermal and mechanical stresses because it is operated at c.a.  $550^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and  $3000~\\mathrm{rpm}$ . Subject for analysis is the disk of  $22^{\\mathrm{nd}}$  stage turbine rotor with central bore and through- thickness key. Operation damage in the form of corner crack with length on the free surface  $a = 12 \\mathrm{mm}$  and depth along shaft thickness  $b = 23\\mathrm{mm}$  was detected in the slot fillet of key in the disc of  $22^{\\mathrm{nd}}$  stage. Prior to lifetime predictions, a 3D FE model of the  $22^{\\mathrm{nd}}$  stage turbine disc section generated was available and used for the purpose of this study. The turbine disc and blades, as well as the rivets incorporated in the original 3D model. The startup power conditions was chosen in stress analysis as it represents the most severe combination of temperature and rotor speed in the operation profile. The material of turbine disc is Steel 34XH3MA which main mechanical properties are listed in Table 1.",

From FE- analysis, it was observed that the peak equivalent von Mises stresses mainly occur on the surface of the slot fillets of key (web and disc bore). It should be noted that the stresses on the free surface and in the slot along hub thickness are 1.2 times higher than the yield stress of Steel 34XH3MA. The special kind of nonlinear calculations accounting for the plastic material properties were performed to determine plastic stress intensity factors  $K_{P}$  for the same crack front profiles in turbine disc after corresponding loading history at operation. Full- field elastic- plastic FEA are performed using ANSYS finite element (FE) code to determine the stress- strain parameter distributions along of the crack- front for turbine disc of considered configuration. With reference to an operation damage the cases considered were a disk with semielliptical corner crack emanating from the intersection of the slot fillet and of the flat surfaces of the disk. The plastic stress intensity factor  $K_{P}$  in pure Mode I was expressed directly in terms of the corresponding elastic stress intensity factor. Figure 5,a shows the dependencies of the plastic SIF on the crack sizes for the turbine disc considered configuration for these two main points, namely, the slot inner surface of key (point  $a$ ) and the free surface of hub (point  $b$ ). The distributions of the plastic SIF's along the crack front in the turbine disk under operation loading are shown in Fig.5,b. These distributions correspond to the initial crack front  $(a_{0} = b_{0} = 3 \\mathrm{mm})$  and the final failure front  $(a = 10 \\mathrm{mm}, b = 20 \\mathrm{mm})$  positions.",

The elastic- plastic solution on based on the plastic SIF's show that the crack would grow on the free surface from  $1.6 \\mathrm{mm}$  to  $10 \\mathrm{mm}$  and in the depth direction from  $1.6 \\mathrm{mm}$  to  $20 \\mathrm{mm}$  in about  $1,300$  cycles.

It should be pointed out that the elastic solution is not accounted for the stress- strain state redistributions at the plastic zone close to the crack tip. The implications due to this limitation may give non- conservative predictions of crack growth rate for this case as the actual stress and strain may be higher than predicted by elastic solution. As the purpose for analyzing the edge crack in the turbine disc considered at the operation was to estimate the crack growth rate under extreme situation, the residual fatigue life should be determined based on the elastic- plastic solution.",
