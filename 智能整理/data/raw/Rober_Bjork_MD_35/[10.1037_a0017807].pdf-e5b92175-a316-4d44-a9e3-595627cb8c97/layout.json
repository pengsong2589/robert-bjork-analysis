We expected a spacing advantage when 1 painting per artist was studied repeatedly and tested (repetition) but perhaps a massing advantage, especially for older adults, when multiple different paintings by each artist were studied and tested (induction). We were surprised to find that spacing facilitated both inductive and repetition learning by both young and older adults, even though the participants rated massing superior to spacing for inductive learning. Thus, challenging learners of any age appears to have unintuitive benefits for both memory and induction."

For example, learning to identify Spanish Colonial architecture involves encountering different buildings that share features but are not exactly the same. In the present study, our focus was on how the spacing of such encounters affects the efficiency of abstracting concepts and categories- - that is, inductive learning. Unlike classroom instruction, inductive learning begins at birth (if not before) and remains essential throughout the life span."

Such spacing effects have been obtained hundreds of times, with children (e.g., Vlach, Sandhofer, & Kornell, 2008), college students (e.g., Smith & Rothkopf, 1984), and older adults (e.g., Balota, Duchek, Sergent- Marshall, & Roediger, 2006). In nearly all of these studies, however, the same information (e.g., an object or a word pair) was presented multiple times to participants. Two then were tested. There are good reasons, as we describe in the following sections, to expect that the pattern for inductive learning might differ when the same information is not repeated."

Moreover, a number of studies have shown that massing, rather than spacing, promotes inductive learning. These studies have generally employed relatively simple perceptual stimuli that facilitate experimental control (Gagne, 1950; Goldstone, 1996; Kurtz & Hovland, 1956; Whitman & Garner, 1963). One intuitive explanation of these findings is that spacing may prevent learners from noticing commonalities between the exemplars that define a given concept or category—an idea we refer to as the massing- aids- induction hypothesis. When learning to identify an artist's style, for example, massing a certain artist's paintings makes it easier to notice characteristics that all of the paintings share and, thus, should aid in encoding a given artist's style. Spacing should make it more difficult to notice commonalities. This difficulty may be especially acute for older adults, who are frequently susceptible to rapid forgetting. The massing- aids- induction hypothesis was memorably captured by Ernst A. Rothkopf, the renowned educational psychologist, who remarked, \"Spacing is the friend of recall, but the enemy of induction\" (as quoted in Kornell & Bjork, 2008, p. 585)."

In their investigation, college undergraduates studied six different paintings by each of 12 relatively obscure artists, either massed (i.e., six paintings by the same artist placed in a row) or spaced (i.e., paintings by various artists interleaved). After studying, participants were shown unfamiliar paintings by the same artists and asked to select, from a list of 12 names, the name of the artist who painted each painting. Contrary to the massing- aids- induction hypothesis, final test performance was consistently and considerably superior in the spaced condition. A large majority of participants,"

Aging- related decrements in learning and memory, however, may have particular implications for inductive learning. Learning a category requires remembering previous category instances when encountering a new instance (e.g., seeing a fir tree and remembering other fir trees that one has encountered), so that the new and old instances can be integrated into a unified concept. Spacing makes this remembering more difficult. We expected older adults to be particularly vulnerable to forgetting previously presented instances across spaced intervals during inductive learning. That is, we predicted that the massing- aids- induction hypothesis might apply to older, if not to young, adults."

Gistbased memories remain relatively intact, relative to verbatim memories, in older adults Adams, 1991Castel, Farb,& Craik,2007; Craik, 2002; Koutstaal, 2003). Thus, older adults' abilities might be well suited to inductive learning. Moreover, if older adults can maintain conceptual memories of a painter's style, they may be well equipped to learn via spaced practice. These speculations lead to two competing hypothesis: Spacing might be particularly harmful to older adults' inductive learning if they forget previous instances of categories too often to form coherent concepts, or spacing might be beneficial to older adults' inductive learning if they are capable of forming and maintaining the sort of gist- based memories that support concept learning."

After the learning phase, participants were shown paintings by the 12 artists and asked to select, from a list of the artists' names, the artist who had painted each painting. After the test, participants were asked which they thought had been more effective: massing or spacing."

The illusion that massing aids induction is apparently powerful (and, to be fair to the participants, it is an illusion that was shared by the experimenters in advance of the research by Kornell & Bjork, 2008). In the repetition condition, spacing was rated as effective more often than was massing, which indeed was the case."

We tested the hypothesis that in the induction condition, spacing would make it difficult to form an accurate concept of painters' styles and, as a result, spacing would be less effective for inductive learning than repetition learning. This massing- aids- induction hypothesis was not supported. Although college students outperformed older adults overall, the two groups produced similar patterns of results: Spacing was superior to massing, and the size of the spacing effect did not depend significantly on whether the learning task involved repetition or induction. Unlike the actual results, the participants' metacognitive ratings conformed to the massing- aids- induction hypothesis. After taking the test, participants in both age groups judged massing to be more effective than spacing in the induction condition but preferred spacing in the repetition condition."

This observation of strong performance by older adults in the more difficult inductive task may have occurred because older adults had relatively intact gistlike memory for the painters' styles. It may be that the engrossing nature of the materials allowed older adults to engage in the type of encoding processes that support schema abstraction (e.g., Castel, 2005, 2007). The observation that spacing can boost memory and induction in older adults, despite overall declines in episodic memory, has important implications for training and improving memory and learning in old age (e.g., Jamieson & Rogers, 2000)."

Up to some point, then, spacing between trials, which produces forgetting and increases the difficulty of retrieval, should enhance both repetition and induction learning. Beyond that point, however, spacing may produce retrieval failures, especially in induction learning and especially in older adults, which would make spacing the enemy of induction. The present results suggest that both the young and older participants achieved successful study- phase retrieval, at least most of the time, but a different procedure, one in which retrieval or concept formation is more difficult, might produce a benefit of massed practice (see Kornell & Bjork, 2008), particularly for older adults."

Learning to identify different varieties of birds, butterflies, and bees; learning a new language or music style; and learning to recognize people's voices or writing styles are all examples of learning that occurs without the need for direct instruction. In advance of their research, Kornell and Bjork (2008) were convinced that such inductive learning would benefit from massing, yet their results showed the opposite. Undaunted, we remained convinced that spacing would be more beneficial for repetition learning than for inductive learning—especially for older adults, given their overall declines in episodic memory. The current results disconfirmed our expectations once again. If our intuitions are erroneous, despite our years spent probing and praising the spacing effect—including roughly 40 years' worth contributed by Robert A. Bjork—those of the average student are surely mistaken as well (as the inaccuracy of the participants' metacognitive ratings suggests). We have, perhaps, fallen victim to the illusion that making learning easy makes learning effective, rather than recognizing that spacing is a desirable difficulty (Bjork, 1994) that enhances inductive learning as well as repetition learning well into old age."
