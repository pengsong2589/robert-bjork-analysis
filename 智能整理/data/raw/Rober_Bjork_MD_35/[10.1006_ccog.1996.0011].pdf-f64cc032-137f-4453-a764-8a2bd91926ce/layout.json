We then argue that the primary means of accomplishing such adaptive updating of human memory is retrieval inhibition: Information that is rendered out of date by new learning becomes less retrievable, but remains at essentially full strength in memory as indexed by other measures, such as recognition and word- fragment completion. We conclude with a speculation that certain unconscious influences of prior events may, in fact, be stronger if those events were to be forgotten rather than to be remembered. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc."

In the laboratory, a number of our research paradigms, such as the Brown- Peterson paradigm and paired- associate list- learning procedures of the A- B, A- C variety, involve an implied—but clear—cue to forget. When each successive word trigram (or some other set of to- be- remembered items) is presented in the Brown- Peterson procedure, for example, it is clear to subjects that the preceding trigram should now be forgotten—that continuing to remember that trigram, now out of date, is a source of confusion and intrusions. Similarly, when—at the start of A- C learning—it is clear that the List- 1 B responses are now history and a potential source of errors, there is again a clear, if implicit, cue to forget."

There is also evidence, however, from studies of both hypnotic directed forgetting (see, for example, Kihlstrom, 1983) and non- hypnotic directed forgetting (see Geiselman, Bjork, & Fishman, 1983) that the state of such to- be- forgotten information in memory has been altered. In terms of source attribution and measures of subjective organization, for example, the state of to- be- forgotten items in one's memory appears to differ markedly from the state of corresponding to- be- remembered items."

Figure 1 illustrates a typical paradigm used to study memory updating or directed forgetting in the laboratory, sometimes referred to as the list method of directed forgetting. In the typical list method of directed forgetting, subjects are presented with lists of items to remember, with the items (e.g., common words) presented one at a time. After some number of items (typically, half) have been presented, the list presentation is interrupted with a cue either (a) to forget the preceding items, as illustrated in the middle list of Fig. 1, or (b) to keep on remembering the preceding items, as illustrated in the left list of Fig. 1. In the following sections of the present paper, these two types of list or cueing conditions are designated as"

Namely, it needs to be made clear that this basic paradigm can be utilized in a totally within- subjects design, as, indeed, was done in all of the studies reported in the present paper. That is, all three of the list types described above can be repeatedly presented to the same subject with no diminution in the effectiveness of the forget cue. One might well think that a cue to forget can only be introduced once- - as a surprise, so to speak. For example, some studies using the list method of directed forgetting introduce the mid- list cue to forget as a surprise to subjects, either by indicating after the presentation of the first list that the first list was just for practice and can be forgotten or, in what is sometimes referred to as the \"whoops!\" procedure, by indicating after presentation of the first list that it was somehow incorrectly presented to them, that they should thus forget it and learn the correct list, which will be presented next. Then, following presentation of the second list, subjects are tested on the items they were instructed to forget as well as those they were instructed to remember. Obviously, such misleading use of the forget cue can only be administered once for any given subject, and, thus, forget- - remember versus remember- - remember list conditions must be manipulated as a between- subjects variable in such directed- forgetting studies."

In all of the studies reported in the present paper, subjects were fully informed as to the meaning of the forget and remember cues before any lists were presented, and the validity of the forget instruction was never violated. Consequently, all of the different types of lists could be repeatedly presented to the same subjects. It should be emphasized, however, that- - although informed that cues to forget and cues to remember can occur on any given list- - subjects have no way of predicting when a cue to forget or when a cue to remember will be presented and, thus, up to the point of the cue, subjects must process all presented information in the same way- - that is, as though they will be asked to remember it.

The first demonstration of this last effect was reported by Bjork, Bjork, and Glenberg (1973). We review their study in some detail below as the procedures they employed are quite similar to those used in the present Experiments 1 and 2, and because it was the implications of this finding for the type of retrieval inhibition involved in the production of directed- forgetting results that largely motivated the present research."

For forget- remember lists, four of the pairs on the recognition test contained new words as the distractors and four pairs contained words from the first half of the list as distractors- - that is, to- be- forgotten words.

The eight \"old' words taken from the second half of the list to appear on the recognition test as the correct items were randomly selected with the constraint that only two could be taken from each quarter of the list; similarly, the four \"old' words taken from the first half of the list to appear as foils on the recognition test were randomly selected with the constraint that only one word could be taken from each fourth of the list.

That is, there is no evidence of spontaneous recovery of proactive interference owing to the to- be- forgotten items in the forget- remember lists during the retention interval filled with an arithmetic task.

An important question arises from this dramatically different outcome of the two types of intervening tasks: Namely, what critical aspects of the recognition test lead to this release of inhibition? The recognition test necessarily involved certain types of search processes, for example. Perhaps there is something critical about the type of search and comparison processes that were evoked by the forced- choice nature of the recognition task? However, in addition, the recognition test involved the reexposure of four to- be- forgotten items as distractors. Which of these factors, if not both, is critical: the processes invoked by the recognition task, whatever they might be, or the reexposure of to- be- forgotten items? We turn now to the report of our first experiment, which attempted to answer these and other questions raised by the Bjork et al. findings."

The change to a yes/no recognition test would allow us to answer the question of whether there was something critical about the forced- choice nature of the recognition test used in the Bjork et al. study that led to the release of inhibition of to- be- forgotten items. For example, perhaps the necessity of having to compare and choose between the remember word and the forget word within a forced- choice pair initiated a type of memory search that helped to lead subjects back to the learning episode involving the to- be- forgotten items. If so, then on a yes/no recognition test in which subjects need consider only one item at a time, the inhibited state of the to- be- forgotten items might not be released. The inclusion of both a yes/no recognition task that presented precue items as foils and one that did not would allow us to answer the question of whether it is processes initiated by the recognition task or the reexposure of to- be- forgotten items that is the critical or essential factor in producing the release from inhibition."

Thus, for the remember- remember lists, 4 precue to- be- remembered words appeared as foils, and for the forget- remember lists, 4 to- be- forgotten words appeared as foils. The remaining 4 foils, for either type of list, were new words. On the recognition test with no precue items as foils, all 8 foils were new items for both remember- remember and forget- remember lists. The recognition tests following control or blank- - remember lists contained only new items as foils because no words were presented prior to the mid- list cue. Old words to appear on the recognition tests either as correct items (i.e., words from the second half of the lists) or as foils (i.e., words from the first half of the lists) were randomly selected with the following constraints: Of the 8 postcue words to appear as correct items, only 2 could be taken from each quarter of the list; of the 4 precue words to appear as foils, only 1 could be taken from each fourth of the list. The positions of correct items and foils were spread more or less evenly across the recognition test."

Planned comparisons also confirmed this pattern of results, revealing postcue recall for the remember- - remember lists to be significantly poorer than that for forget- - remember lists, whereas performance levels for the forget- - remember and the blank- - remember conditions did not differ, "

In the first case, the proactive interference owing to the to- be- forgotten items was reinstated following the recognition task, whereas in the second case, there is no reinstatement of proactive interference. A reexposure of to- be- forgotten items is, thus, an apparently necessary condition for reinstating their potential interference or for releasing their inhibition."

First, precue to- be- forgotten items—unlike precue to- be- remembered items—are somehow prevented from interfering with the recall of postcue to- be- remembered items on either an immediate recall test or on a recall test that is delayed by an arithmetic task. When, however, the recall test for postcue to- be- remembered items is delayed by a recognition test of postcue to- be- remembered items on which a few to- be- forgotten items appear as distractors, proactive interference from the entire list of precue to- be- forgotten items is reinstated, as evidenced by the drop in recall of postcue to- be- remembered items to the level of that obtained when subjects do not receive instructions to forget the precue items. If, however, the recognition test for postcue to- be- remembered items does not re- present any precue to- be- forgotten items as distractors, then the entire set of to- be- forgotten items remains inhibited, as evidenced by the lack of any proactive interference effects."

That is, in this latter situation, the inhibition of the entire set of to- be- forgotten items is apparently released, even though only a subset of to- be- forgotten items appear as foils on the recognition test."

What exactly is inhibited as a consequence of the directed- forgetting instructions and then released by certain tasks—such as the recognition test involving to- be- forgotten items as distractors? One possibility is that the overall access to a to- be- forgotten item as a lexical entry is inhibited—or possibly, something more purely episodic is being inhibited, such as the process of retrieving items from the specific to- be- forgotten episode. These various possibilities as to the nature of the inhibition created by instructions to forget are addressed in the next experiment of the present paper by examining the effects of to- be- forgotten information when assessed by both direct and indirect measures of memory."

Thus, no item differences or presentation- order differences are involved when making comparisons across list type conditions, testing conditions, or between to- be- forgotten and to- be- remembered words. Additionally, counterbalancing procedures were used such that the precue and postcue words appearing on the word- fragment- completion task for half the subjects appeared as new words for the other half of the subjects and vice versa. Thus, no item differences need to be considered when testing for priming effects on the word- fragment- completion task—that is, when comparing differences in the completion rates for old versus new words."

Given that to- be- forgotten items were inhibited, as evidenced by their lack of interference on the recall of to- be- remembered items, two critical questions remain. First, was access to the to- be- forgotten items- - as appropriate completions on the word- fragment- completion task- - also inhibited? That is, was the completion rate for precue to- be- forgotten words significantly lower than that for precue to- be- remembered words and, possibly, not different from the completion rate for new, or unprimed, words? A positive answer to this question would indicate that the effects of the inhibitory processes initiated by the cue to forget were not limited to inhibiting conscious access to the precue list- learning episode, but also extended to the inhibition of specific- item representations in semantic memory- - that is, that the activation of the specific to- be- forgotten items themselves has been inhibited. The results shown in Table 1 contain the answer to this first question."

That is, subjects' access to to- be- forgotten words as lexical entries- in response to a word- fragment cue- was either not inhibited by the directed- forgetting instructions or, possibly, any such inhibition was released during the word- fragment- completion task, analogous to recognition testing that involves reexposure to List- 1 items. The second critical question, then, is whether the intervening word- fragment- completion task reinstated the proactive interference owing to to- be- forgotten items. The answer to this question is contained in the results displayed in Fig. 5, which presents the delayed recall performance obtained for each type of list."

One such condition is that at least some subset of the to- be- forgotten items must be reexposed to subjects. Mere exposure, however, is not sufficient. During this exposure, the forgotten material must be processed in a manner that accesses, or makes contact with, the initial learning episode."

We also stressed that retrieval inhibition is a critical aspect of such forgetting. Under some conditions, however, as we have demonstrated, interference owing to the previously inhibited out- of- date information can return full blown. Additionally, even when to- be- forgotten information remains inhibited, in the sense that conscious access to that information is impeded—and proactive interference owing to that information is reduced, such information can continue to influence our judgments and behavior. In the remainder of this section, we speculate on what the properties of the retrieval inhibition evoked by cues to forget imply with respect to our ability to perform optimally in different types of situations. To aid this discussion, we first interpret the findings of the present studies in terms of the distinction between direct and indirect measures of memory."

Thus, for example, if the prior presentation of a given word increases the likelihood that a subject can complete that word from letter fragments (R__S__N), or from a stem (REA__ ) or ending (SON), or can identify that word when it is briefly exposed, we infer that the prior episode involving that word had an impact on the subject's memory. Examples of other indirect tests are perceptual identification, homophone biasing, evaluative responses, and certain nonverbal changes. Direct tests, such as tests of recall and recognition, on the other hand, instruct the subject to refer directly to the target episode itself."

Interpreted in this way, it is rather easy to see that these results have important implications for how certain types of work situations or contexts should be structured- - or perhaps, more to the point, should not be structured. For example, in occupations or job contexts that involve updating and/or frequent changing of plans- - occupations that could range from short- order cooks to air- traffic controllers to any number of white- collar jobs where current accounts or cases involve different values of the same variables involved in prior cases- - any reexposure to items that have been forgotten, in response either to a direct or to an implicit cue to forget, should not also ask for a judgment of some kind that makes reference to the out- of- date context. The use in certain work situations of a checkoff procedure in which now out- of- date items appear, for example, may be counterproductive if, as a result, such information is then more likely to intrude into the new context where it is no longer appropriate and will be a source of confusion."

Thus, the present results as well of those of Basden et al. raise the issue of whether other analogous dissociations exist- - that is, whether there are other instances in which subjects' intentional recall of to- be- forgotten items is impaired, but the indirect influence of those items on some other task remains unabated."

Jacoby and his co- workers (see, e.g., Jacoby & Kelley, 1987; and Jacoby, Kelley, & Dywan, 1989) have provided convincing evidence that we are often unaware of the influence of some prior experience on a current judgment of some type. In one series of experiments, for example, in which subjects are asked to judge whether each of a series of names (e.g., Sabastian Weisdorf) is famous or not—that is, whether a given name is the name of a celebrity of some kind—the prior presentation of a given nonfamous name in an earlier phase of the experiment increased the likelihood that subjects falsely judged that name to be famous, even though—24 h earlier—those names were clearly labeled nonfamous. That is, the familiarity of such names owing to their having been presented in an earlier phase of the experiment is apparently misattributed to real world exposures of one kind or another. Jacoby, Woloshyn, and Kelley (1989) have shown further that such misattributions are more frequent when the initial presentation of such nonfamous names takes place under conditions of divided attention. Under such conditions, subjects are less able to identify the earlier experimental episode as the source of the familiarity of a given name. In general, such results are consistent with the well- known “sleeper” effect in social psychology: that the influence of a noncredible source of information can grow over time—that is, can grow as subjects lose the ability to attribute their memory for that information to an unreliable or untrustworthy source."

If subjects suffer a kind of source amnesia for to- be- forgotten information, analogous to that fostered by divided attention, the unconscious influence of the information may actually be greater than the influence of comparable to- be- remembered information. That is, in a judgment task where it is important to identify a to- be- remembered or to- be- forgotten episode as the source of potentially misleading information, subjects may be less able, in the case of to- be- forgotten information, to identify the episode in question as the source of that information."
