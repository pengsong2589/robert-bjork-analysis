Overall, taking a multiple- choice test boosts performance on later tests, as compared with nontested control conditions. This benefit is not limited to simple definitional questions, but holds true for SAT II questions and for items designed to tap concepts at a higher level in Bloom's (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives. Students, however, can also learn false facts from multiple- choice tests; testing leads to persistence of some multiple- choice lures on later general knowledge tests. Such persistence appears due to faulty reasoning rather than to an increase in the familiarity of lures. Even though students may learn false facts from multiplechoice tests, the positive effects of testing outweigh this cost."

Tests are used to hold schools accountable for their students' progress and to moni- . ter the advancement (or lack thereof) of individual students. Recent policy shifts such as No Child Left Behind have added to a zeitgeist of testing, albeit one that is controversial. In policy and in educational research, tests are viewed as tools for measuring students' mastery of skills and knowledge. Research questions and practical concerns revolve around the fairness of the tests and whether the tests are measuring the qualities they are supposed to assess. Although issues of test content, scoring, and bias are important, the emphasis on testing as assessment can lead to the presumption that tests measure a student's knowledge without affecting that knowledge. In fact, however, research conducted in both experimental and educational settings demonstrates that tests not only measure what is learned, but also alter the nature and accessibility of students' knowledge (e.g., Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b; Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2001)."

One of the earliest studies on testing, conducted by Spitzer (1939) and involving 3,605 sixth graders from Iowa, examined the effects of eight different testing schedules on the students' memory for two passages, one on peanuts and the other on bamboo. Each of Spitzer's 25 multiple- choice items paired the correct answer with four incorrect choices. At various points in time after reading the passages, Spitzer compared the performance of students who were taking the test for the first time with that of those who were taking it for the second time. As long as the initial test occurred within three weeks of learning, students who had previously taken a test outperformed students who had not. A week after learning, for example, previously tested sixth graders answered an average of 11.8 items correctly on the final test, whereas students taking a test for the first time answered only 7.9 items correctly."

Across subjects,passage facts were either tested on an initial multiple- choice test or not tested at that time; they received no feedback on their multiple- choice answers. Five minutes later, all subjects took a final open- ended (cued recall) test. Students correctly answered more questions such as\"How many planets separate Jupiter from the sun?\" if they had previously answered a parallel multiple- choice question "

That is, simply taking a multiple- choice general knowledge test boosts performance on a later cued recall test, even if there was no study phase in the experiment (Roediger & Marsh, 2005). In this case, the test links to and activates preexperimental knowledge. The test may cue knowledge that might not have been retrieved otherwise, such as marginal knowledge (Berger, Hall, & Bahrick, 1999), which is defined as knowledge that is available but not readily accessible (Turving & Pearlstone, 1966). One example might be the name of the author of the fable \"The Fox and the Sour Grapes.\" Berger and colleagues demonstrated that such marginal knowledge can be made accessible and is subsequently very slowly forgotten if the answer (Aesop, in this case) is presented. In principle, and almost certainly in practice, presenting marginal knowledge as one alternative on a multiple- choice test is likely to have similar positive effects. In addition, multiple- choice tests may teach students new facts, because students use reasoning to eliminate lures, select the correct answer, and thereby learn it."

Tests serve as an additional study opportunity, offer retrieval practice, and provide retrieval cues in the form of answer options. Compared with restudying material, testing is also a better processing match to later tests. Given the myriad ways in which multiple- choice tests can aid memory, more testing might seem the obvious recommendation to improve learning and performance. Recent research, however, suggests that testing may also change memory in ways that are not always for the better. The question we now address is whether multiple- choice tests also provide opportunities for the learning and retrieval practice of incorrect answers."

Consistent with this analysis, testing increases later ratings of the truth of multiple- choice lures, although they are still rated as less true than known facts (Toppino & Brochin, 1989; Toppino & Lulpersboeck, 1993). Similarly, testing increases the production of multiple- choice lures as answers to later cued recall questions, even when students are strictly warned against guessing (Roediger & Marsh, 2005).

That is, if mere familiarity were driving the effect (akin to an illusory truth effect), then persistence of errors should not have been limited to previously selected lures—because, presumably, even nonselected lures would have been read, and thus would have accrued familiarity. When, however, students answered a final cued recall question with a lure they had read on the previous multiple- choice test, their error was almost always the same as the answer they had previously chosen. Rarely did students select the correct answer on the initial test and then produce a lure on the final test. Nor were students likely to select Lure A on the first test and then produce Lure B on the final test (Butler, Marsh, Goode, & Roediger, 2006; Roediger & Marsh, 2005). Errors that persisted were those that had been endorsed on the first test."

Specifically, manipulations of the number of multiple- choice lures have had inconsistent effects on later tests (Brown, Schilling, & Hockensmith, 1999; Roediger & Marsh, 2005; Whitten & Leonard, 1980). For example, Whitten and Leonard found a benefit in later free recall for words that had been grouped with more lures on a prior recognition test, whereas Roediger and Marsh showed a cost. Although there were many differences between Whitten and Leonard (1980) and Roediger and Marsh (2005), follow- up studies suggested that the critical difference was the level of performance on the initial multiple- choice test (Butler et al., 2006). Subjects in Whitten and Leonard's list learning experiment were successful in selecting the studied item even when it was grouped with additional nonstudied words, whereas subjects in our prose learning experiments were less able to select the correct answer when it was"

That is, the persistence of errors on the final test was higher (36%) when subjects reasoned about their choices using supporting information (i.e., most animals sleep on their bellies, after incorrectly selecting on their bellies as the position in which sea otters sleep), or using their own personal experience (persistence of 67%; e.g., I went there on vacation with my Aunt). Persistence of errors tends not to arise from a simple boost in familiarity, but rather from a reasoning process in which the error is linked to other world knowledge and integrated into a knowledge base."

To have an impact on the educational community, studies must use more realistic materials, which is why we have highlighted studies involving prose and general knowledge questions. And yet, these are still relatively simple materials. Educators want much more from students than the ability to list capitals of countries and to provide the definitions of vocabulary words; they want students to move beyond the who, what, and where questions to answer why. In Bloom's (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives, knowing basic facts is only the first of his six goals for the student: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Thus, a critical issue is, What are the effects of multiple- choice tests when the questions tap higher levels of learning, as defined by Bloom's taxonomy?"

Taking the SAT II also boosted production of the multiple- choice lures on the final test from a baseline of 7% of responses (when students had not taken the SAT prior to the cued recall test) to 16% (when they had). The overall error rate, however, was not higher following testing. That is, although students learned incorrect answers from the test and their use of specific multiple- choice lure answers was boosted on the final test, they also produced fewer other wrong answers after testing."

Further support comes from a study in which we manipulated how concepts were tested (Marsh, Bjork, & Bjork, 2006). Each concept was tested at Level 1 (definitional) or Level 3 (application) in Bloom's taxonomy. For example, consider the parallel questions created to test the concept of acclimation. The Level 1 (definitional) version of the question read What biological term describes an organism's slow adjustment to new conditions? whereas the Level 3 (application) version read What biological term describes fish slowly adjusting to water temperature in a new tank? Critically, the answer choices were the same for the two conditions: in this example, acclimation, gravitation, maturation, and migration."

The answer proved to be yes. For example, selecting a lure (e.g., gravitation) as the answer to a multiple- choice question such as \"Allowing new fish to adjust slowly to tank water temperature is an example of what biological phenomenon?\" increased students' likelihood of later using that lure to answer a transfer question such as \"Animals that thicken their fur during winter are exhibiting what biological phenomenon?\" Note that the superficial similarity between the questions is minimal, but the questions are conceptually similar: They both test an application of the concept acclimation. Again, the data suggest that effects of multiple- choice tests go beyond simple priming of errors; multiple- choice lures may become integrated into subjects' more general knowledge and lead to erroneous reasoning about concepts."

As has also been demonstrated in research on metacognitive judgments (Spellman & Bjork, 1992), tests modify the knowledge they are designed to assess.

However, we also found that tests can teach"

Tests, optimally constructed, can enhance later performance, provide feedback to the learner on what has and has not been learned, and potentiate the efficiency of subsequent study opportunities (see McDaniel, Roediger, & McDermott, 2007). It is not the case, though, that just any test will have all those virtues and at the same time avoid the negative consequences. What is required to construct optimal tests is an understanding of the processing dynamics triggered by testing. We see our research as a step in that direction."
