We examined whether individuals in the broader—and typically older—population might hold different beliefs about how best to study and learn, given their more extensive experience outside of formal coursework and deadlines. Via a web- based survey, however, we found striking similarities: Learners' study decisions tend to be driven by deadlines, and the benefits of activities such as self- testing and reviewing studied materials are mostly unappreciated. We also found evidence, however, that one's mindset with respect to intelligence is related to one's habits and beliefs: Individuals who believe that intelligence can be increased through effort were more likely to value the pedagogical benefits of self- testing, to restudy, and to be intrinsically motivated to learn, compared to individuals who believe that intelligence is fixed."

Bjork (1994) coined the term, “desirable difficulties,” to refer to the set of study conditions or study strategies that appear to slow down the acquisition of to- be- learned materials and make the learning process seem more effortful, but then enhance long- term retention and transfer, presumably because contending with those difficulties engages processes that support learning and retention. Examples of desirable difficulties include generating information or testing oneself (instead of reading or re- reading information—a relatively passive activity), spacing out repeated study opportunities (instead of cramming), and varying conditions of practice (rather than keeping those conditions constant and predictable)."

Similarly, Karpicke, Butler, and Roediger (2009) surveyed students' study strategies and found that re- reading was by far the most popular study strategy and that self- testing tended to be used only to assess whether some level of learning had been achieved, not to enhance subsequent recall."

In fact, Kornell and Bjork's (2007) survey showed that students' study decisions tended to be driven by impending deadlines, rather than by learning goals, and that students tended not to return to material they considered (rightly or wrongly) learned, or return to material after a course has ended. Hartwig and Dunlosky (2012) administered this same survey to a second sample of undergraduate students at a different university and found strikingly similar results. Furthermore, they demonstrated that students' learning habits do matter: Students with lower grade- point averages (GPAs) were more driven by deadlines and reported less self- testing than did students with higher GPAs."

One potential candidate is an individual's theory of intelligence (Dweck, 1999)—that is, whether they are “fixed” (also referred to as “entity”) theorists, who believe that intelligence is innate and cannot be changed, or “growth” (or, “incremental”) theorists who believe that intelligence can be increased through effort. In both correlational and experimental research, one's theory of intelligence has been shown to impact not just academic achievement (e.g., Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Mangels, Butterfield, Lamb, Good, & Dweck, 2006; Mueller & Dweck, 1998), but also motivation and use of learning strategies. Growth theorists are more likely than fixed theorists to hold mastery, rather than performance, learning goals (Blackwell et al., 2007; Dupeyrat & Mariné, 2005), are more likely to change learning strategies and persist in the face of difficulty, and use deeper processing strategies during learning (Ommundsen, 2003; Grant & Dweck, 2003). Conversely, fixed theorists tend to believe that ability itself is sufficient for learning, and effort merely reflects a lack of ability (Blackwell et al., 2007; Dweck & Master, 2008)."

Most of the research exploring strategy use and preferences by fixed versus growth theorists has not, however, focused on the specific learning techniques that Dunlosky et al. (2013) deemed most effective (e.g., spacing, rather than massing, repeated study sessions, and testing, rather than recopying or restudying, to- be- learned information). Rather, many used survey items where effort could be engaged in both efficient and less efficient ways, such as \"when I decide to study, I set aside a specific length of time and stick to it\" (from the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory, Weinstein, Schulte, & Palmer, 1987) or \"when I study for a test, I practice saying the important facts over and over to myself\" (from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, Pintrich & DeGroot, 1990). Understanding how attitudes towards—and adoption of—effective but effortful strategies such as spacing and testing is related to a learner's theory of intelligence was one goal of the present research. To the extent that learners fail to appreciate the benefits of effective study techniques because these techniques make learning feel less fluent and more difficult (e.g., Alter & Oppenheimer, 2009; Benjamin, Bjork, & Schwartz, 1998; Schwarz et al., 1991), are growth theorists less likely to fall prey to metacognitive illusions and possess the insight to appreciate the benefits of desirable difficulties?"

The survey also included three questions to assess participants' intrinsic theory of intelligence (from Chiu, Hong, & Dweck, 1997). Appendix A contains the instructions and questions asked.

Although there are a few differences (e.g., the MTurk sample are more likely to reread whole chapters when studying than are the students), what is most striking are the similarities in reported study habits. The MTurk participants, like the students, are primarily driven by deadlines (the most popular response—75% of our students and 58% of the non- students—was to study whatever is due soonest or overdue). The non- students within our MTurk sample was, however, somewhat more likely than the students, to choose to study whatever they found interesting (9%, vs. 3% of the MTurk students, and 4% and 5% in Kornell & Bjork, and Hartwig & Dunlosky, respectively), presumably due to the greater flexibility and choice in study material among participants who are not enrolled in classes. Interestingly, however, fewer respondents in the MTurk sample plan their study ahead of time and study what they have scheduled (8% of our non- students and 7% of our students, vs. 11% and 13% in the previous student samples)."

In contrast, research shows that tests benefit learning, both for correctly answered items and incorrectly answered items, provided the failed testing is followed by feedback (see Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a, for a review of the testing effect). The benefits of testing persist even when testing takes away from study time (e.g., Kornell, Hays, & Bjork, 2009; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b). Do the responses to Kornell and Bjork's (2007) quiz question (question 8, see Appendix A), however, truly reflect"

Figure 1 shows the proportion of participants' response by their categorical theory of intelligence (fixed vs. growth). Few participants reported that self- quizzing is useful only when they got the answers correctly and for checking their knowledge, and there was no difference in the proportion of fixed and growth theorists on these responses. The majority of people believe that self- quizzing is helpful for either only incorrectly answered questions or all questions. Interestingly, it appeared that growth theorists were more likely to appreciate the benefit of testing for all tested material. Fixed theorists, on the other hand, most often responded that quizzing was helpful only for those questions that they answered incorrectly, perhaps reflecting a belief that if they had answered correctly, then no extra learning can take place."

                                    "content": "Students' judgments of learning made during learning are often inaccurate. Kornell and Bjork (2008) for instance showed that participants tended to drop flashcards while studying GRE words (i.e., judged that they had maximally learned those words), even if they could not remember the definition of dropped words in a later recall test. Indeed, high accessibility (i.e., feeling that information is easy to retrieve) during study does not necessarily reflect strong long- term learning (Bjork & Bjork, 1992). Information can be easy to retrieve for a number of reasons. Consecutive, repeat studying (massing) of to- be- learned information, for example, might make learning on those repetition trials feel easy only because that information had very recently been studied, without allowing time to forget it; conversely, spaced repetitions can make learning feel more effortful and less effective (Zechmeister & Shaughnessy, 1980). These subjective experiences, however, stand in direct contrast to a massive body of literature that demonstrates that spaced practice is more effective for long- term learning than is massed practice (see Cepeda et al., 2006, for a review of the spacing literature). A metacognitively sophisticated learner, therefore, should return to studied material after a break to restudy or test themselves on that material. Consistent with prior research, however, our sample did not tend to restudy information considered learned over the course of studying, nor did they tend to return to old course material."

Listing them roughly in order (from least to most) on how much each strategy engages the learning and leads to effective long- term learning, they are: Rereading, underlining, recopying notes, creating outlines, creating diagrams, testing with flashcards, and self- testing. Consistent with the findings of Karpicke et al. (2009), the most popular strategy was to reread information (75% of participants reported regularly rereading information), despite the fact that rereading is a relatively passive strategy—and arguably, the least effective strategy of the seven. Another popular strategy was underlining (59%), which again, has failed to demonstrate real learning benefits (rated as having “low utility” in the Dunlosky et al., 2013 review)."

Contextual variation has been shown to improve long- term learning as well as transfer (e.g., Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978). One corollary of this finding is that instead of always studying in the same place, one should study in different places. In contrast to research findings, people were over three times more likely to be taught (22% vs. 7%)—and were actually more likely (20% vs. 14%)—to study in the same place than in different places. Though more people study in different places than had been taught to do so, this pattern is more likely reflective of practical constraints than a metacognitive awareness of the benefit of contextual variation."

This similarity, however, means that even in the real world, away from the time- pressures and exam- based assessments of college, people engage in far- from- optimal learning behaviors. More specifically, people are still largely driven by deadlines, underappreciate the pedagogical power of testing, tend not to restudy information that they consider \"learned\" or to return to old course materials, and rely heavily on passive and less effective study strategies, such as rereading and underlining."

Our findings are consistent with previous literature, underscoring fixed theorists’ belief that ability is stable, that what had been learned in the past may still be retained now, and that effortful study reflects a lack of ability rather than learning progress (e.g., Dweck, 1999; Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin & Wan, 1999; Rhodewalt, 1994; Blackwell et al., 2007; Dweck & Master, 2008)"

That is, we think it is rare for students and instructors to recognize the difference between long- term learning and current performance and to understand that some difficulties may be desirable. As learners appreciate that long- term learning typically calls for greater effort, and that effective learning should not necessarily feel easy, they may gradually come to understanding intelligence as something that can be increased."
