Within Nelson and Narens's (1994) influential framework, students are characterized as confronting three types of decisionsâ€”selection of kind of processing, allocation of study time, and termination of study. We have expanded that framework to include decisions about study strategies and scheduling. We focus on microlevel decisions (e.g., \"Do I know this word pair well enough to stop studying it?\"), as did Nelson and Narens, but we also address some macrolevel issues (e.g., \"What topic should I study tonight?\")."

Research by Kornell and Metcalfe (2006) demonstrates that when people decide what to study, a great deal depends on whether their goal is to master all to- be- learned information or only some of it. When the participants studied a list of word pairs and were then allowed to select half of those pairs for restudy, they chose yet- to- be- learned pairs, presumably with the goal of learning all of the pairs. Contrary to what was, until recently, the prevailing view, people do not always focus on the most difficult items, however. When the participants had to select word pairs to study from the list of pairs they had failed to recall on the preceding trial, making mastery impossible, they responded by selecting the easiest of these yet- to- be- learned items."

Koriat and Bjork (2005), for example, found that cued recall of pairs with a strong forward association (\"kittencat\") was much higher than was the recall of pairs with a weak forward association (\"cat- kitten\"), but participants predicted equivalent recall of such pairs. Koriat and Bjork attribute such misassessment to a foresight biasâ€”that is, in the presence of information that is available at study but unavailable and required at test, people are unable to discount the influences of that information (e.g., the backward association in \"cat- kitten\"). One behavioral consequence is misguided study time allocation. Participants, for example, chose to study forward and backward pairs for about the same amount of time (Koriat & Bjork, 2006a, 2006b). They shifted, across study- test trials, to spending more time on backward pairs but apparently did so for item- specific, not principled, reasons: Given a new list containing forward and backward pairs, they again devoted equal study time to both, unless they were provided an explicit explanation of the difference between forward and backward pairs. (These findings highlight that perseverance in studying, if mostly self- perpetuating, can be influenced by analytical processes.)"

Often, however, people stop studying when they do not know the informationâ€”when, for example, they are under time pressure or they feel that the information is either not learnable or not worth learning (e.g., when students decide to study for a grade of B). Moreover, to know information can mean many things. Knowing something right now, for example, is different from knowing it in the future, and people can sometimes dramatically underpredict their own forgetting (see Koriat, Bjork, Sheffer, & Bar, 2004). After students learn something in the short term, do they realize they are likely to forget it and therefore make coming back to it later a priority?"

In one condition, participants were asked to make a JOL when, and only when, they dropped a card. Using a 0, 20, 40, ... 100 scale, they predicted the likelihood that they would be able to recall the dropped item on the final test, with 0 indicating the lowest JOL and 100 indicating the highest. We anticipated that the JOL ratings for dropped items would pile up at the high end of the scale, with a smaller pile at the low end (i.e., for items deemed too difficult to learn), but this was not the case; the distribution we obtained is shown in Figure 1. The average JOL score was a mere "

The participants' task was to learn the styles of twelve different artists by studying six paintings by each artist. A given painting was presented once. For six of the artists, all six of their paintings were presented in succession (massed), the paintings by the other six artists were interleaved (spaced). After the study session, participants were shown new paintings one at a time and asked to identify each painting's artist. After that test, participants were asked which type of presentation, massed or spaced, they thought had best facilitated their learning of the artists' styles. Actual performance exhibited a robust spacing effect (78% of participants did better in the spaced condition), but only 22% of the participants thought they had done better in the spaced condition, even though the JOL took place after the test, for which they had received feedback. In this particular situation, it appears that students would choose massed practice if given a choice, however counterproductive that choice might be."

To address whether people spontaneously space study activities, Son and Kornell (2007) asked participants to schedule their own studying of a set of 16 to- be- learned synonyms (e.g., \"obfuscate- confuse\"). They were shown all 16 cue words on the left side of a computer monitor and 8, 16, or 24 \"slots\" on the right side of the monitor. Participants were told to click and drag the cues that they wanted to study into the slots and that when they finished, they would be allowed to study each of the pairs in that order. (Because there were 16 slots, repeating items was necessary only in the 24- slot condition, but every participant in the 16- slot condition opted to repeat at least one item, and 9 of 25 participants in the 8- slot condition repeated an item.) Participants spaced their study significantly more than would have been predicted by chance."

Participants decided which mode to start in, and they could change the mode at any time (the mode applied to the entire list, not to one item a time). As Figure 2 shows, participants began in presentation mode but quickly shifted to test mode once they became familiar with the pairs. Thus, at a micro level, people chose to test themselves while studying, at least after learning had reached a certain level (also see Son, 2005)."

However, the task of becoming a metacognitively sophisticated learner is far from simple; it requires going against certain intuitions and standard practices, having a reasonably accurate mental model of how learning works, and not being misled by short- term performance and certain subjective indices (see Bjork, 1999).An obvious first step in helping students learn how to learn is to teach them how to learn, but only one in five students in our survey reported having been taught study strategiesand those strategies may not have been optimal."
