We have expanded that framework to include decisions about study strategies and scheduling.

Koriat and Bjork attribute such misassessment to a foresight bias—that is, in the presence of information that is available at study but unavailable and required at test, people are unable to discount the influences of that information (e.g., the backward association in \"cat- kitten\"). One behavioral consequence is misguided study time allocation. Participants, for example, chose to study forward and backward pairs for about the same amount of time (Koriat & Bjork, 2006a, 2006b). They shifted, across study- test trials, to spending more time on backward pairs but apparently did so for item- specific, not principled, reasons: Given a new list containing forward and backward pairs, they again devoted equal study time to both, unless they were provided an explicit explanation of the difference between forward and backward pairs.

Knowing something right now, for example, is different from knowing it in the future, and people can sometimes dramatically underpredict their own forgetting (see Koriat, Bjork, Sheffer, & Bar, 2004).

Our hypothesis was that participants would drop items that they deemed learned, leaving themselves additional time to focus on yet- to- be- learned items, which would result in better later recall in the drop condition than in the no- drop condition. In fact, the opposite happened: Performance was better when people could not drop items (63% accuracy vs.  $59\\%$ ). This finding is all the more remarkable because flashcards include two features, self- testing and spaced repetitions, that have been shown to positively affect judgments of learning (JOLs) (Dunlosky & Nelson, 1992) and, presumably, decisions to drop. The finding is attributable, in part, to poor performance by participants who dropped all of the items before  $10\\mathrm{min}$  had elapsed, thereby giving themselves less study time in the drop condition than in the no- drop condition.

For six of the artists, all six of their paintings were presented in succession (massed), the paintings by the other six artists were interleaved (spaced). After the study session, participants were shown new paintings one at a time and asked to identify each painting's artist. After that test, participants were asked which type of presentation, massed or spaced, they thought had best facilitated their learning of the artists' styles. Actual performance exhibited a robust spacing effect (78% of participants did better in the spaced condition), but only 22% of the participants thought they had done better in the spaced condition, even though the JOL took place after the test, for which they had received feedback.

Applying research on cognition to education requires focusing on the system level on the relationship between courses, on instructional activities and requirements, and so forth- as well as on what students can and should do on their own to enhance learning.",

However, the task of becoming a metacognitively sophisticated learner is far from simple; it requires going against certain intuitions and standard practices, having a reasonably accurate mental model of how learning works, and not being misled by short- term performance and certain subjective indices (see Bjork, 1999).An obvious first step in helping students learn how to learn is to teach them how to learn, but only one in five students in our survey reported having been taught study strategiesand those strategies may not have been optimal.",
