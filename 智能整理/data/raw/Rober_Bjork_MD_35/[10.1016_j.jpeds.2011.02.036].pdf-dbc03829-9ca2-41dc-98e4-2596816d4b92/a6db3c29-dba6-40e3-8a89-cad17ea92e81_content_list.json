New studies suggest that recurrence rates may be even higher. Although the scientific importance of baby/sibling research is undeniably high, this method contains an intrinsic sampling bias in that, by design, it targets only families with an already existing child with autism. As such, resulting ASD samples are only those from multiplex families. Differences in rates of genetic mutations and indexes of fetal development between singleton and multiplex cases suggest",

Neuroscience has provided strong evidence implicating the profound impact of early environmental manipulation on the developing brain.8 The opportunity to begin the treatment of autism specifically around the first birthday, an age when brain growth is altered,9–11 has not been systematically achieved but seems to have potential to change outcome for affected children. Unfortunately, there are currently no valid autism- specific screening tools for the 12- month age. In 2002, however, Wetherby and Prizant12 developed a general broadband screen, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant- Toddler Checklist (CSBS- DP IT- Checklist), that detects a wide range of disorders such as global developmental delay, general language delay, and autism between 6 to 24 months.

The CSBS- DP- IT- Checklist is ideal as a first pass developmental screen because it was originally designed to detect children with communication delays and not autism per se. Given that children at risk for an ASD often have delays in language, it would be expected to detect a considerable percentage of infants at risk for an ASD, as well as those that were experiencing an LD or global DD. $^{12,13}$  If used as a broadband screen for research purposes, the use of the CSBS- DP- IT- Checklist yields three natural contrast groups (ASD, LD, and DD), an essential consideration given the somewhat overlapping behavioral phenotype of these groups at a young age.

Additionally, unlike other studies wherein a research assistant approached every parent in a waiting room and obtained informed consent,26 this study evaluated the ease with which a pediatricians' office could actually implement the screening process with their own employees and not research assistants. Although a promising new autism toddler screen, the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, has been developed, the full screen has not been tested for use in a pediatrician's office but rather was administered in the home setting at a mean age of 16 months,30 and infants did not receive a full developmental evaluation",

Furthermore, field test results for the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire indicated that of  $>36000$  infants screened, only 18 were identified as having ASD. In this study 32 infants with ASD were identified with far fewer screens (ie, 10 479), suggesting that the CSBS- DP- IT- Checklist may be particularly effective as an early screening tool for autism. The study by Wetherby et al<sup>12</sup> focused on the CSBS- DP- IT Checklist. In that study parents in the general community were first mailed an information packet, and interested parents returned the completed screening form anytime when their infant was between 6 and 24 months via mail. There was the potential for a selection bias in that parents with strong concerns about their infant were more likely to return the screening form.<sup>12</sup> Results from this study, which screened solely in pediatric offices and were possibly less susceptible to selection bias, found an almost identical positive predictive value at 12 months  $(75\\%)$  compared with what was found by the mail- in study by Wetherby et al<sup>12</sup> at 12 months  $(73\\%)$ .

It is unlikely that treatment would have been initiated for these children at such an early age had it not been for this program. Almost all treatments were behaviorally based, with the most common modalities being speech therapy, discrete trial training, and pivotal response training. Overall, infants received an average of 7.6 hours of one- on- one treatment per week, with a greater number of treatment hours for the children with DD and ASD in comparison with those with LD. Most of these infants began treatment at or before 18 months in age.",

Although clinically desirable and a possible line of future inquiry, this study did not set out to determine sensitivity and specificity of the CSBS- DP- IT- Checklist. The initial validation study of the instrument,<sup>12,13</sup> not conducted in pediatric offices and with slightly older children, estimated good sensitivity  $(88.9\\%)$  and specificity  $(94\\%)$ . Data from this study are not well- suited to replicate and extend these findings because only 41 infants who passed the initial screening were followed, and estimates of sensitivity and specificity, which take into account both true- and false- negative results, are strongly influenced by the number of infants tracked who passed the initial screening. Our data do speak to the estimated positive predictive value of the screening, however, because positive predictive value takes into account only infants who failed the screening, and we were able to track 184 such infants. We were also able to note that, similar to findings from the later validation study,<sup>12</sup> there is a somewhat high- false positive rate of the CSBS- DP- IT- Checklist. Another potential limitation is that  $28\\%$  of the toddlers with ASD in the sample have not been monitored through to the full 32 to 36 months of age called for in the study (but rather only until 24 months). It is possible that some diagnoses may change in this small group, although several studies have empirically demonstrated the stability of diagnoses at or around 24 months.<sup>18–20,31</sup> Although the utility of this approach for detecting young ASD cases around the first birthday is strong, future iterations of this program could be improved if a second screening were administered 1 year later, at 24 months, to detect late onset and regression cases that were missed by the 12- month screening. Future versions of this program should also attempt to improve the tracking of infants who failed the screening form but were not actually referred for participation in the program. The large discrepancy between the number of failures and the number of referrals to the program could be due to a lack of follow- through on the part of pediatricians, the perception that the infant was not in need of an evaluation, or referral to different organizations.

Available data are presented as # of points failed or passed by rather than total raw score due to different cut off scores for different ages (eg, total test cut off score is 27 at 12 months, but 28 at 13 months). Note that an infant can fail the CSBS-DP-IT-Checklist in one of three ways: by falling into the \"range of concern\" on the social subsection, the symbolic subsection, or the overall test score. Given this, an infant can \"pass\" the overall test but still be considered in the concern range due to the failure of a single subsection. In the current sample this was the case with 17 toddlers who passed the overall test, but were referred for evaluation due to a failure on one of the subsection scores."
