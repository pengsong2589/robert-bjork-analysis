This paper reports an experimental test of the two classes of theory. Rather than manipulate spacing, the experiment varied the information processing difficulty of the activity interpolated between two presentations of an item. Consolidation- type theories imply decreasing consolidation with increasing difficulty of the interpolated activity. In fact, recall performance following two presentations separated by a difficult task was found to be slightly but consistently better than performance following two presentations separated by an easy task. The outcome thus favors encoding- type theories."

The stimulus fluctuation versions of stimulus sampling theory (Estes, 1955; Izawa, 1967), the multistate Markov models of Bjork (1966), Greeno (1967), Rumelhart (1967) and others, and the encoding variability ideas of Martin (1968) and Melton (1969) are all examples of the differential encoding class."
